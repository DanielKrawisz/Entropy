## Long-Range Forces

### Localism

Newton proposed that all matter is attracted to all other matter via a force that is proportional to the mass of both bodies and which diminishes with the inverse square of the distance. He called this force *gravity* and used it to explain both the cohesion of the Earth and all Earthbound matter and the motion of the orbits of the planets, which obeyed Kepler's laws. 

His proposal was controversial because it violated the principle of *localism*, which requires that objects cannot interact without being nearby to one another. People had always understood that objects have weight that causes them to fall towards the Earth from any height that anyone had experienced, people did not imagine that this force extended far outwards into the heaven's. Although Newton's gravity fell off with distance, in theory it extended to the stars without limit. 

By contrast, Descartes had attempted to explain the orbits of the planets by vorticies that spun around the sun and pushed on the planets like a kind of wind and he criticized Newton's theory as a kind of mathematical abstraction which did not necessarily pertain to the fundamental nature of the univrse.  Privately, Newton agreed with Descartes that a fundamental theory ought to be local. 

As time went on, other long-range forces came to be understood. The electric force appears very similar to gravity but has a key difference: it is proportional to charge rather than mass. This has two important implications. First, the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Second, that an electric interaction with a distant charged body can be detected without a telescope because two bodies with a different ratio of charge to mass can be observed to accelerate differently. 

The magnetic force also obeys an inverse-square law, but unlike the electric and gravitation forces is proportional to current, which means that two charged bodies do not have a magnetic interaction unless they are both moving. 

Ultimately, these forces were found to obey local principles as Newton and Descartes had long ago expected. These principles are called Einstein's special and general relativity. Einstein's special relativity was abstracted from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, a theory that unified the electric and magnetic forces with light. Einstein's general relativity was discovered by Einstein in his attempt to discover a set of equations that described gravity in analogy to those of Maxwell. 

### Galilean Physics

The breakthroughs that made Galileo the father of modern mechanics had to do with the way he approached time. Previously, physicists had generally attempted to describe the motion of bodies in terms of geometric curves, which would tend to abstract away a notion of where the body was at a given time. The biggest successes in physics prior to Galileo had to do with motion that was so fast that it could be taken to be instantaneous, as in optics, or motion that could be measured in terms of natural cycles, as in astronomy. Galileo developed new experimental methods to measure small amounts of time and a theoretical approach to motion that treated time as the independent variable. 

In other words, Galileo conceptualized the motion of a body as a position function $x:time->space$ and attempted to explain it by relating physical concepts to the derivatives of the function $x'(t)$, $x''(t)$, and so on. In physics, he first derivative of the position is called the *velocity* and the second is called the *acceleration*. 

$$v(t) = x'(t)$$

$$a(t) = x''(t) = v'(t)$$

Galileo attempted to describe physics in terms of what would now be called differential equations. By contrast, geometers like Apollonius of Perga treated curves in terms of relationships between geometric objects. For example, a point on a parabola is always the same distance from some given point called the *focus* and a line called the *directrix*. Although conic sections are important in physics, they are not the whole story of any kind of motion. For example, Galileo observed not only that free-falling bodies trace out parabolas, but that their motion parallel to the surface of the Earth is uniform. This observation adds a nuance which might have been missed by a geometer that prefigures the later notion of a force vector. 

Since Galileo, the most fundamental laws of physics have all been of the form 

$$a(t) = f(x(t), v(t))$$

where $f$ is some function. Differential equations of form are called *second-order*, which means that all derivatives of $x$ that are second-order or higher are determined by $x$ and its first derivative. At some time $t_0$, both $x(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$ can be thought of as free parameters. Once they are given, then the entire function is determined for all time, both backwards and forwards. This is true because 

$$x(t) = \iint dt^2 a(t)$$

If $a(t)$ is determined but not $x(t)$, each integral will involve an additive constant that one is free to select as desired. These can be selected to set the values of $v(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$. Once given, no other free parameters are available. 

This is why higher derivatives of the position do not have their own name. They are all determined by the acceleration and do not enter into the differential equation, so there's no reason to talk about them very much. 

### Inertia

Galileo attempted to imagine the motion of a body isolated from all interactions with other bodies and to approximate it as best he could experimentally and concluded that it would be absolutely uniform. In other words, an isolated body would move along a straight line at constant velocity, which is described by the law 

$$a(t) = 0$$

This principle is called the *law of inertia*. Newton included it as his first law of motion. 

Interactions evidently result in some acceleration, but an acceleration is not the same as an interaction. 

Inertia was thought of as something that resists a change in velocity. 

But what is doing the resisting and what is it resisting? Newton's second law provides an answer. 

$$a(t) = \frac{F (v(t), x(t))}{m}$$

### Linear Momenta 

### The Principle of Relativity

The principle of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. There are two versions of the principle of relativity: Galilean relativity and Einsteinian special relativity. Einstein's general relativity includes the special relativity, but it also says that the laws of physics are the same in non-inertial reference frames as well. Often, pre-Einsteinian physics is called *nonrelativistic*, which is not true. Galilean relativity has this name not because Galileo discovered it, but because it was always implicit in Galilean physics. 

The principle of relativity is made concrete with some transformation that explains how to look at the world from the perspective of any inertial observer. If the principle of relativity is true, then this transformation will leave the laws of physics unchanged. In Galilean relativity, this is called the Galilean transform. In Einstein's special relativity, it is called the Lorentz transform. The Galilean transform is simply the addition of a velocity to everything. 

$$\bar{x}(t) = x(t) + v t$$
