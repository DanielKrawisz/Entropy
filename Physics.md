# Matter and Motion

## Long-Range Forces

### Localism

Newton proposed that all matter is attracted to all other matter via a force that is proportional to the mass of both bodies and which diminishes with the inverse square of the distance. He called this force *gravity* and used it to explain both the cohesion of the Earth and all Earthbound matter and the motion of the orbits of the planets, which obeyed Kepler's laws. 

His proposal was controversial because it violated the principle of *localism*, which requires that objects cannot interact without being nearby to one another. People had always understood that objects have weight that causes them to fall towards the Earth from any height that anyone had experienced, people did not imagine that this force extended far outwards into the heavens. Although Newton's gravity fell off with distance, in theory it extended to the stars without limit. 

By contrast, Descartes had attempted to explain the orbits of the planets by vorticies that spun around the sun and pushed on the planets like a kind of wind and he criticized Newton's theory as a kind of mathematical abstraction which did not necessarily pertain to the fundamental nature of the univrse.  Newton's famous statement "I frame no hypothesis" was already a response to this objection. His laws were derived empirically from what had been observed in planetary motion and were not claimed to be statements about fundamental causes. Privately, however, Newton agreed with Descartes that a fundamental theory ought to be local. 

As time went on, other long-range forces came to be understood. The electric force appears very similar to gravity but has a key difference: it is proportional to charge rather than mass. This has two important implications. First, the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Second, that an electric interaction with a distant charged body can be detected without a telescope because two bodies with a different ratio of charge to mass can be observed to accelerate differently. 

The magnetic force also obeys an inverse-square law, but unlike the electric and gravitation forces is proportional to current, which means that two charged bodies do not have a magnetic interaction unless they are both moving. 

Despite Newton, it appears that these laws are quite fundamental. They are still a part of the best currently known laws of physics, even while other qualities of matter that were unexplained in Newton's day, such as heat, have long since been explained in more fundamental terms. However, with Einstein's special and general theories, localism was resored and found not to be incompatible with long-range forces. 

How is such a thing possible? At the very least, a local theory of long-range forces must admit waves. Imagine two bodies that interact via long-range force. If one of the bodies starts to oscillate, the other body must start oscillating as well because the force on it from the first body is changing with its positoin. However, it cannot start oscillating right away because that would be instantaneous communication with the distant other body. The second body must oscillate, but after a time delay. During this time delay, where are the oscillations? They must be travelling through space, between the two bodies. 

Einsteinian theories, those compatible with the special or general theory, all work like this. The force is no longer a true interaction between distant bodies. It is a local interaction with a force field that fills all of space and admits waves. This revised understanding of long-range forces began with the discovery of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, a theory that unified the electric and magnetic forces with light, which turned out to be electromagnetic waves. Newton had, of course, studied light but had never imagined that it was so closely connected with his idea of force. 

Einstein's special relativity was abstracted from Maxwell's equations and his general relativity was discovered by Einstein in his attempt to discover a set of equations that described gravity in analogy to those of Maxwell. Although Einstein's special and general theories are usually and were originally described as theories of *relativity*, relativity has been a part of physics since the time of Galileo. Before Einstein's general theory, the principle of relativity was understood to mean that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial reference frame, meaning that two scientists can pass each other and both think that they are standing still and that the other scientist is moving fast. No experiment they could do would elevate one perspective over the other, as long as neither was accelerating. 

Einstein's special theory did not change the general idea but it did propose that the speed of light was an *exception* to the principle of relativity. Thus despite the fact that theories which incorporate Einstein's relativity are called "relativitstic", the special theory was actually *less* relativistic than the physics of Galileo. Einstein's general theory greatly expanded the principle of relativity to include accelerated reference frames, which could be understood as stationary motion with resistance to a gravitational field. 

With the special theory, Einstein emphasized relativity because the principle of relativity had been temporarily disturbed due to an incompatability between Maxwell's equations and earlier mechanics. Both of these theories obeyed the principle of relativity on their own, but had different ways of changing perspectives which, when put together, destroyed relativity. For mechanics, a change in persective was called the Galilean transformation, and for Maxwell's equations it was called the Lorentz transformation. These two theories put together were not relativistic and they implied that some scientist could detect his velocity relative to the speed of light, which was absolute. 

Einstein argued, however, that physics really *is* relativistic by noting that the Lorentz transform can be understood in terms of the principle of relativity, and that all mechanics could be reformulated to be compatible with the Lorentz transform. This argument not only restored relativity to physics but restored localism as well, which had been missing for a much longer time. Einstein emphasized relativity because that was the current crisis in physics in his day, but vindicating Descartes was a more important legacy of the special theory. 

The compatibility of long-range forces with localism is, in large part, the story of modern physics. The theories which have made this possible are called gauge theories. Gauge theories describe not just electromagnetism and gravity, but the strong and electroweak forces as well. The gauge theory idea is so big that it bridges classical and quantum physics, all the way to gravitation and curved space. Ideas that go beyond known physics, such as grand unified theories and string theory are also gauge theories. Physics has yet to really move past the gauge theory idea, and it all begins with Maxwell. It is arguably the biggest idea in physics and if not it is certainly one of the two biggest ideas in physics, the other being quantum mechanics. 

### Quantum Mechanics

The purport of quantum mechanics is that the best possible laws of physics that we could intuit from experience are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Probability is not new in physics. What is new about probability in quantum mechanics is that it is no longer due entirely to an imperfection in our experimental method but belongs to the fundamental nature of the universe. 

Like many ideas in physics, quantum mechanics is poorly named due to having been discussed before being understood. 

### Gauge Theories

It is hard to explain what a gauge theory is without a lot of mathematical preparation, but physicists like to describe the world in terms of quantities that are physically real only in the way that they change but not in their absolute value. These quantities are integrals, which means that there is an arbitray additive constant to them, as anyone would have got used to seeing in a calculus class. Energy is an example of such a quantity. The potential energy is a spacial integral, and any additive constant can be added to it to produce identical physics. Physicists typically define the potential energy to ensure that bound states correspond to negative values of potential energy and unbound states to positive values, but this is done for convenience, not because it is required physically. 

To put it vaguely, when the geometry of a theory works out just right, there can be integral quantities that that support a larger range of parameters than simply an additive constant. In a gauge theory, the potentials can be changed by an abstract rotation over all of space and time. Gauge invariant quantities obey partial differential equations that are elliptic and hyperbolic in different derivatives, which means that they describe an evolution of oscillation in time while at the same time obeying constraints ensuring that distant objects always remain connected by a long-range force. 

An implication of gauge theories is that all long-range forces in three special dimensions are inverse square with the distance, as we have observed. Although Newton studied other kinds of forces that he could imagine, such as an inverse cube force, these kinds of forces cannot be reconciled with localism. Quantum mechanical gauge theories can lead to confinement, which means that the force is inverse square for short distances but eventually becomes stronger with distance. This is why quarks are confined to hadrons. Gauge theories also predict a conservation of charge. In the case of gravity, the charges are energy and momentum, so general relativity predicts that these are both conserved, something that had been observed long before Einstein explained it. 

## Inertia

### Galilean Physics

The breakthroughs that made Galileo the father of modern mechanics had to do with the way he approached time. Previously, physicists had generally attempted to describe the motion of bodies in terms of geometric curves, which would tend to abstract away a notion of where the body was at a given time. The biggest successes in physics prior to Galileo had to do with motion that was so fast that it could be taken to be instantaneous, as in optics, or motion that could be measured in terms of natural cycles, as in astronomy. Galileo developed new experimental methods to measure small amounts of time and a theoretical approach to motion that treated time as the independent variable. 

In other words, Galileo conceptualized the motion of a body as a position function $x:time->space$ and attempted to explain it by relating physical concepts to the derivatives, $x'(t)$, $x''(t)$, and so on, of position. In physics, he first derivative of the position is called the *velocity* and the second is called the *acceleration*. 

$$v(t) = x'(t)$$

$$a(t) = x''(t) = v'(t)$$

Velocity is not the same thing as speed. Velocity is speed together with direction. There can be negative velocities. Speed is the absolute value of velocity. 

Galileo attempted to describe physics in terms of what would now be called differential equations. By contrast, geometers like Apollonius of Perga treated curves in terms of relationships between geometric objects. For example, a point on a parabola is always the same distance from some given point called the *focus* and a line called the *directrix*. Although conic sections are important in physics, they are not the whole story of any kind of motion. For any curve there are many parameterizations, whereas a physical motion represents one individual parameterization. Galileo observed not only that free-falling bodies trace out parabolas, but that their motion parallel to the surface of the Earth is uniform. This observation adds a nuance that prefigures the later notion of a force vector which might have been missed by a classical geometer. 

Since Galileo, the most fundamental known laws of physics have had the form  

$$a(t) = f(x(t), v(t))$$

where $f$ is some function. Differential equations of this form are called *second-order*, which means that all derivatives of $x$ that are second-order or higher are determined by $x$ and its first derivative. This is why higher derivatives of the position do not have their own name. They are all determined by the acceleration and do not enter into the differential equation, so there's no reason to talk much about them. 

If a function like $f$ can be determined from observations of moving bodies, then it can be used to predict the motion of a body given an initial position $x_0$ and velocity $v_0$ at a given time $t_0$. Since 

$$x(t) = \iint dt^2 a(t)$$

the position is determined from the acceleration up to two arbitrary additive constants of integration. 

$$\iint dt^2 a(t) = \int dt \bar{v}(t) + C_v = \bar{x}(t) + C_v t + C_x$$

Here $\bar{v}$ and $\bar{x}$ are indefinite integrals that result from integrating $a$. The constants of integration $C_v$ and $C_x$ can be selected to set the values of $v(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$. Once given, no other free parameters are available. 

Of course, the integral cannot be performed because initially we do not know acceleration as a function of time, other than at $t_0$ when it can be determined from $f(x_0, t_0)$. However, implicitly there is still some function $a(t)$ which could be integrated if it were known. 

### Inertial Motion

Science typically proceeds by separating things into smaller pieces so that they can be examined in isolation and controlled experiments can be designed with them. Thus Galileo attempted to imagine what motion without interaction would be like by extrapolating from what he could observe. He could not prepare a frictionless vaccuum, but he could observe what happened as friction and other interactions were minimized. He imagined a ball that rolled along an infinite flat plane without friction and argued that it would roll at the same velocity forever. 

Motion at constant velocity is called *inertial* and is described by the law 

$$a(t) = 0$$

Evidently, if there is no interaction then there is no acceleration. If we want something interesting to happen, we need more than one body. We will do this with an index on $x$ to make it a sequence rather than a single value. 

$$a_i(t) = \sum_{j : i\neq j}f_{j->i}(x_j(t), v_j(t))$$

Where $f_{j->i}$ is the acceleration caused by body $j$ on body $i$. 

### Inertia and Newton's First Law

*Inertia* is an archaic concept that has no place in modern physics but which has been frozen into the jargon because of the influence of Kepler, the one who first proposed it. 

Newton's overriding influence. Inertia was defined by him as "a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to persevere in its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a right line". However, in the present discussion, inertia should be understood as a word that refers to motion at constant velocity and has no other connotation. 

In my reading of Newton, it appears that his discussion of inertia engages with earlier work on physics but is made obsolete later by the introduction of Newton's three laws of motion and after that is no longer relevant. If you were to do experiments to attempt to approximate an isolated body, perhaps by rolling balls on flat surfaces, you would notice that the balls rolled father as they stopped as you reduced friction or sources of interactions with the ball. You might also notice that you need to push the ball more to make it move at higher speeds. This is how you might come up with something like inertia, if you didn't have a clear concept of force. 

The principle of inertia is often conflated with Newton's first law, but it is not the same thing. Newton's first law says "every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon". Thus, the first law establishes that motion at constant velocity is the natural motion of an isolated body, which is what the previous section was about. The first law does not say that a body resists change or what happens when the force acts on it, whereas the principle of inertia does. According to the principle of inertia, if a force acts on a body, the body will resist changing its velocity in reaction to that force. Thus, the principle of inertia is much more like Newton's second law, except that the second law is a lot better because it establishes *how* the body resists the force, which is in proprtion to its mass. In fact, I would say that Newton's second law emplies that inertia cannot be anything *other* than mass. 

You would only say that Newton's first law and the principle of inertia are equivalent if you were imagining that some power of resistance is required to keep a body at a constant velocity, as if some internal force always exists to degrade its motion, something you would only think inertial motion rather than slowing down and standing still, which is what you would think if you still believed with Aristotle that a body's natural motion was to approach a state of rest, a notion that had been refuted not just by Galileo but by Jean Buridan long before. Indeed, this concept of inertia is much closer to how it was originally defined by Kepler, who described inertia as a force that prevents a moving body from slowing down. 

Thus, the principle of inertia is *not* the same as Newton's first law and inertia is not an explanation for inertial motion. Ineria is simply a confusing vestage in modern physics. We have a much better explanation for inertial motion and that is the principle of relativity, to be discussed in the next sectoin. 

Having established that no interaction implies no acceleration, is it also the case that no acceleration implies no interaction? No, for two reasons. The first is that two opposite forces can cancel each other out. This is why modern textbooks often change Newton's first law to say that a body does not divert from inertial motion unless there is a *net* force. Second, a body can have internal motions that that change without affecting its net motion. For example, a body could grow hotter or colder. As we will see, light and other things that move at the speed of light cannot change their speed, but they can still react to forces along their direction of motion. They all have a wavelength which can widen or shrink. 

### Principle of Relativity

The *Principle of Relativity* is an explanation for inertial motion that does not require the introduction of concepts like inertia or force. It states that the laws of physics are the same in any *inertial reference frame*, which means from the perspective of some inertial body. A body that is standing still is an inertial body, and therefore other inertial bodies could take the perspective of themselves as standing still and this would be a valid way of looking at their own physical system. 

We all know that a body that is initially standing still will not spontaneously start moving. If the principle of relativity is true, then an inertial body also could not spontaneously slow down. If it did, then from its own perspective it would appear to start moving spontaneously. 

Galileo proposed the principle of relativity and used it to argue that the Earth could orbit the Sun without producing any obvious effects in the direction of the Earth's motion, such a kind of wind tearing away the atmosphere. He imagined a laboratory in a moving ship on a very calm sea and asked whether a scientist inside would be able to tell that the ship was moving. 

*Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need to throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every direction.*



### Symmetry

The principle of relativity is an example of a symmetry principle, which are of central importance in modern physics. Something that is *symmetric* can be transformed in some way that leaves it unchanged. The known laws of physics have quite a complex set of symmetries. One of these is translational symmetry. This means that no position in space is special, in the same sense that the principle of relativity says that no velocity is special. We can regard any point in space as being at the center of the universe and The principle of relativity implies translational symmetry because if we look at the world from the perspective of different velocities, we would perceive events as taking place at different positions in space. 

Another important symmetry is rotatational symmetry. If the universe is rotationally symmetric, then there is no special direction. If there were some special direction, you could say that resting bodies accelerate in that direction, so we actually needed rotational symmetry before. 

Symmetry arguments like this have taken a central position in physics because they accomplish much for little effort. 

### Einstein's Special Relativity

### Lorentz Transformations

## Conservation of Momentum

### Linear Momentum 

Now that we know what non-interaction is like, what is interaction like? 

Linear momentum was originally conceived by Descartes as a quantity of motion that would be conserved in all interactions. He observed that a moving ball that strikes a stationary ball will be slower after the collision whereas the ball that was struck will be faster. He proposed that some quantity of motion must have been transferred from one ball to another. 

We call this quantity *linear momentum* because, as we will see, later physicists generalized the concept of momentum to something that is not always conserved and that is quite different from the original idea. 

Linear momentum is usually written with the letter $p$. If it is conserved, then 

$$\frac{d p}{d t} = 0$$

It must be proportional to velocity, by the principle of relativity. 

$$p = m v$$

If this is so, then any change in velocity of a body must correspond to a change in momentum. Since changes in velocity correspond to interactions and since momentum is conserved, all interactions can be understood as transfers of momentum from one body to another. The constant of proportionality is called the mass, and it can be measured by testing how easy it is to change the velocity of an object. 


If it satisfied  

$$F = \frac{d p}{d t}$$

then it would always be conserved because every force would be cancelled out by an equal and opposite force on another body, implying that the sum of all changes to momentum would be zero. Therefore, momentum must be 

$$p = \int dt \frac{d p}{d t} = \int dt F = \int dt m a(t) = m v + C = m v$$

This quantity we call linear momentum because, as we will see, later on in physics the word *momentum* was used in a generalized sense to include other quantities that are not necessarily conserved. 

We will see that the law of inertia is more correct than Newton's second law. When Einstein's special theory is introduced, the principle of inertia will remain and 


### Newton's Second and Third Laws

Newton's second law is a more concrete version of the law of inertia. It says 

$$a(t) = \frac{F (v (t), x (t))}{m}$$

where $m$ is the mass of the body. More massive bodies resist changes in velocity more than less massive bodies. Thus, according to the second law, mass in the resistance described in the principle of inertia. 

$$resistance(z) = \frac{z}{m}$$

Of course, the second law is more commonly written as 

$$F (x(t), v(t)) = m a(t)$$

We can combine this law with the first law with 

$$F_{i j} (x_j(t), v_j(t)) = m_i a_i(t)$$

where $F_{i i} = 0$.

Newton's third law establishes the connection between a force and an interaction. It says that every interaction between two bodies $i$ and $j$ is characterized by two equal and opposite forces. This means that we can write the force as 

$$F_{i j} (x_i(t), v_j(t), x_j(t), v_j(t))$

where $F_{i j} = -F_{i j}$, which implies $F_{i i} = 0$.



We define a space 

## Newtonian Physics

### Euclidian Space

There are two kinds of Euclidian space. One of them is the space that was actually studied by Euclid and the other is what modern mathematicians call Euclidian space, which is quite different although superficially similar. We will use the later but explain the differences with the former. The essentials of Euclidian space, from the modern perspective, are that it comes with notions of distance and angle and that it is flat, like the tables on which geometric constructions were originally performed. 

Euclid's original space had these properties but it also was two-dimensional and relied entirely on compass and straightedge constructions. A compass is a device for drawing circles and a straightedge is for drawing straight lines. It is through the use of these devices that consistent notions of distance and angle emerged in Euclid. However, they also resulted in a different notion of magnetude than we use today. Euclid did not have a concept of the real numbers, which are foundational in modern treatments. All magnetudes in Euclid are what we would now call algebraic numbers, which means that they correspond to solutions of rational polynomials. And not just any polynomial either. The intersections of straight lines with straight lines, straight lines with circles, and circles with circles correspond to basic polynomials that can be combined with one another to produce more polynomials via methods that correspond to geometric constructions. The set of polynomials that can be constructed in this manner is not the full set of rational polynomials. Consequently there are many numbers that seem quite natural to us that Euclid could not construct, for example $\sqrt{7}$ was entirely beyond Euclid. 

The limitations of compass and straight edge constructions were understood by ancient mathematicians in terms of three famous problems that they could not solve: the trisection of an angle, the doubling of the cube, and the construction of a circle with the same area as a given square. Much of modern mathematics was founded through investigations into what made these problems unsolvable by Euclid. However, physicists don't care about any of that and don't know anything about compass and straight edge constructions. Modern physicists use the real numbers, which are defined in terms of limits of rational numbers. They have no touble trisecting an angle if they feel like it. 

However, the real numbers come with their own difficulties. Any sequence of rational numbers with a limit is a real number. There is a problem with determining whether two real numbers are equal, but we do not have to imagine that we ever have a set of all real numbers so that is not a problem. However, there is a potential problem due to a consequence of Godel's theorems, which is that it is not necessarily the case that two convergent sequences of rational numbers can be proven to be either equal or unequal. 

Real numbers turn into a big problem in physics later when we get to quantum field theory. 

Thus, the modern notion of space as continuous needs to be viewed as an idealization that we cannot currently avoid, not knowing enough about what it is *really* like on a small scale. 

Although Euclid's work is today considered to be a foundational work of mathematics, in some ways it is better understood as a work of physics. Euclid originated the axiomatic method in mathematics, which was so influential that virtually all mathematicians have used it since then. 

The flatness of Euclidian space is a consequence of Euclid's fifth postulate, which says that a point can be constructed from any two lines that are not parallel. The fifth postulate is disturbing because it implies knowledge of space over distances much bigger than any real table. The intersection of two nearly parallel lines could be arbitrarily far away. How would we have abstracted that such a point exists from our experience of real tables, compasses, and straight edges? This may have been a mistake because, as it turns out, curved spaces approach flat space over short distances. Thus, space over real tables may have been imperceptively curved the whole time. 

Nowadays, 

As to Euclidian space being flat, that is intuitive for two-dimensional space, but what does it mean to be flat in higher dimensions? For our purposes, flatness can be understood in terms that are intuitive to imagine. One is that all triangles have $180^\circ$ in them, just as in the two-dimensional version of Euclid. The other is that two figures of different sizes can be congruent. In other words, a big triangle with the same angles at its corners as a small triangle can be uniformly scaled down to fit on top of the little triangle. A flat space in higher dimensions will retain these properties. In curved space this does not work because there is a relationship between the area of a triangle and the sum of its angles. 

### Modern Euclidian Space

### Vectors

Given that we have already discussed Newton's three laws, what is left to put in this chapter on Newtonian physics? In addition to establishing a clear concept of force, Newton also formulated physics in a way that was suitable for bodies moving freely in three dimensional space, whereas the physics of the last chapter was one-dimensional. 

In modern language, Newton formulated his physics in terms of vectors. 

The word *vector* means something different to physicists as to mathematicans. To mathematicians, a vector is an element of a vector space, whereas to physicists a vector is a field that transforms as the vector representation of the rotation group. 

*Field* is another word that means something different to mathematicians vs physicists. To physicists, a field is a function over space. To mathematicians, a field is a set, such as *R* or *C* that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

### Mechanics



## Rotation

Rotational physics has a theory that is exactly analagous to Newtonian physics. 

orientation - position
angular velocity - velocity
angular acceleration - acceleration
moment of inertia - mass
angular momentum - momentum
torque - force

The complexity lies in understanding the form of rotational quantities, which are more complicated than in the Newtonian theory. In $N$ dimensions, position is simply a list of $N$ numbers and derivatives of position are vectors. A rotation is described by a matrix whose inverse is its own transpose. Thus the angular velocity and acceleration are derivitaves of such a thing, whatever that is. 

### Two Dimensions

In two dimensions, a rotation is entirely described by an angle. 

### Three Dimensions

In three dimensions, a rotation must be specified by both an axis and an angle. 

### Parity

I lied above when I said a three-dimensional rotation is a vector. It is actually a pseudo-vector.
