# Long-Range Forces

## Conceptual Introduction

### Localism

Newton proposed that all matter is attracted to all other matter via a force that is proportional to the mass of both bodies and which diminishes with the inverse square of the distance. He called this force *gravity* and used it to explain both the cohesion of the Earth and all Earthbound matter and the motion of the orbits of the planets, which obeyed Kepler's laws. 

His proposal was controversial because it violated the principle of *localism*, which requires that objects cannot interact without being nearby to one another. People had always understood that objects have weight that causes them to fall towards the Earth from any height that anyone had experienced, people did not imagine that this force extended far outwards into the heavens. Although Newton's gravity fell off with distance, in theory it extended to the stars without limit. 

By contrast, Descartes had attempted to explain the orbits of the planets by vorticies that spun around the sun and pushed on the planets like a kind of wind and he criticized Newton's theory as a kind of mathematical abstraction which did not necessarily pertain to the fundamental nature of the univrse.  Newton's famous statement "I frame no hypothesis" was already a response to this objection. His laws were derived empirically from what had been observed in planetary motion and were not claimed to be statements about fundamental causes. Privately, however, Newton agreed with Descartes that a fundamental theory ought to be local. 

As time went on, other long-range forces came to be understood. The electric force appears very similar to gravity but has a key difference: it is proportional to charge rather than mass. This has two important implications. First, the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Second, that an electric interaction with a distant charged body can be detected without a telescope because two bodies with a different ratio of charge to mass can be observed to accelerate differently. 

The magnetic force also obeys an inverse-square law, but unlike the electric and gravitation forces is proportional to current, which means that two charged bodies do not have a magnetic interaction unless they are both moving. 

Despite Newton, it appears that these laws are quite fundamental. They are still a part of the best currently known laws of physics, even while other qualities of matter that were unexplained in Newton's day, such as heat, have long since been explained in more fundamental terms. However, with Einstein's special and general theories, localism was resored and found not to be incompatible with long-range forces. 

How is such a thing possible? At the very least, a local theory of long-range forces must admit waves. Imagine two bodies that interact via long-range force. If one of the bodies starts to oscillate, the other body must start oscillating as well because the force on it from the first body is changing with its positoin. However, it cannot start oscillating right away because that would be instantaneous communication with the distant other body. The second body must oscillate, but after a time delay. During this time delay, where are the oscillations? They must be travelling through space, between the two bodies. 

Einsteinian theories, those compatible with the special or general theory, all work like this. The force is no longer a true interaction between distant bodies. It is a local interaction with a force field that fills all of space and admits waves. This revised understanding of long-range forces began with the discovery of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, a theory that unified the electric and magnetic forces with light, which turned out to be electromagnetic waves. Newton had, of course, studied light but had never imagined that it was so closely connected with his idea of force. 

Einstein's special relativity was abstracted from Maxwell's equations and his general relativity was discovered by Einstein in his attempt to discover a set of equations that described gravity in analogy to those of Maxwell. Although Einstein's special and general theories are usually and were originally described as theories of *relativity*, it is only the general theory that was an innovation in relativity. The innovation of the special theory was localism. 

Before Einstein's general theory, the principle of relativity was understood to mean that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial reference frame, meaning that two scientists can pass each other and both think that they are standing still and that the other scientist is moving fast. No experiment they could do would elevate one perspective over the other, as long as neither was accelerating. Relativity had been a part of physics since the time of Galileo and Einstein did not change this with his special theory. The general theory expanded the principle of relativity to include accelerated motion. In the general theory, two scientists could accelerate relative to one another and disagree on who was doing the acceleration. They could each see themselves as standing still and resisting a gravitational force. 

With the special theory, Einstein emphasized relativity because the principle of relativity had been temporarily disturbed due to an incompatability between Maxwell's equations and earlier mechanics. Both of these theories obeyed the principle of relativity on their own, but had different ways of changing perspectives which, when put together, destroyed relativity. For mechanics, a change in persective was called the Galilean transformation, and for Maxwell's equations it was called the Lorentz transformation. These two theories put together were not relativistic and they implied that some scientist could detect his velocity relative to the speed of light, which was absolute. 

Einstein argued, however, that physics really *is* relativistic by noting that the Lorentz transform can be understood in terms of the principle of relativity, and that all mechanics could be reformulated to be compatible with the Lorentz transform. This argument not only restored relativity to physics but restored localism as well, which had been missing for a much longer time. Einstein emphasized relativity because because that was the current crisis in physics in his day, but vindicating Descartes was a more important legacy of the special theory. 

The compatibility of long-range forces with localism is, in large part, the story of modern physics. The theories which have made this possible are called gauge theories. Gauge theories describe not just electromagnetism and gravity, but the strong and electroweak forces as well. The gauge theory idea is so big that it bridges classical and quantum physics, all the way to gravitation and curved space. Ideas that go beyond known physics, such as grand unified theories and string theory are also gauge theories. Physics has yet to really move past the gauge theory idea, and it all begins with Maxwell. It is arguably the biggest idea in physics and if not it is certainly one of the two biggest ideas in physics, the other being quantum mechanics. 

It is hard to explain what a gauge theory is without a lot of mathematical preparation, but physicists like to describe the world in terms of quantities that are physically real only in the way that they change but not in their absolute value. These quantities are integrals, which means that there is an arbitray additive constant to them, as anyone would have got used to seeing in a calculus class. Energy is an example of such a quantity. The potential energy is a spacial integral, and any additive constant can be added to it to produce identical physics. Physicists typically define the potential energy to ensure that bound states correspond to negative values of potential energy and unbound states to positive values, but this is done for convenience, not because it is required physically. 

To put it vaguely, when the geometry of a theory works out just right, there can be integral quantities that can be changed not just by a total constant but by an abstract rotation function defined over all of space. This is called a gauge transformation. Gauge invariant quantities obey partial differential equations that are elliptic and hyperbolic in different derivatives, which means that they describe an evolution of oscillation in time while at the same time obeying constraints ensuring that distant objects always remain connected by a long-range force. 

An implication of gauge theories is that all long-range forces in three special dimensions are inverse square with the distance, as we have observed. Although Newton studied other kinds of forces that he could imagine, such as an inverse cube force, these kinds of forces cannot be reconciled with localism. Gauge theories also predict a conservation of charge. In the case of gravity, the charges are energy and momentum, so general relativity predicts that these are both conserved, something that had been observed long before Einstein explained it. 

## Galilean Physics

### Differential Equations in Terms of Time

The breakthroughs that made Galileo the father of modern mechanics had to do with the way he approached time. Previously, physicists had generally attempted to describe the motion of bodies in terms of geometric curves, which would tend to abstract away a notion of where the body was at a given time. The biggest successes in physics prior to Galileo had to do with motion that was so fast that it could be taken to be instantaneous, as in optics, or motion that could be measured in terms of natural cycles, as in astronomy. Galileo developed new experimental methods to measure small amounts of time and a theoretical approach to motion that treated time as the independent variable. 

In other words, Galileo conceptualized the motion of a body as a position function $x:time->space$ and attempted to explain it by relating physical concepts to the derivatives of the function $x'(t)$, $x''(t)$, and so on. In physics, he first derivative of the position is called the *velocity* and the second is called the *acceleration*. 

$$v(t) = x'(t)$$

$$a(t) = x''(t) = v'(t)$$

Galileo attempted to describe physics in terms of what would now be called differential equations. By contrast, geometers like Apollonius of Perga treated curves in terms of relationships between geometric objects. For example, a point on a parabola is always the same distance from some given point called the *focus* and a line called the *directrix*. Although conic sections are important in physics, they are not the whole story of any kind of motion. For example, Galileo observed not only that free-falling bodies trace out parabolas, but that their motion parallel to the surface of the Earth is uniform. This observation adds a nuance which might have been missed by a geometer that prefigures the later notion of a force vector. 

Since Galileo, the most fundamental laws of physics have all been of the form 

$$a(t) = f(x(t), v(t))$$

where $f$ is some function. Differential equations of form are called *second-order*, which means that all derivatives of $x$ that are second-order or higher are determined by $x$ and its first derivative. At some time $t_0$, both $x(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$ can be thought of as free parameters. Once they are given, then the entire function is determined for all time, both backwards and forwards. This is true because 

$$x(t) = \iint dt^2 a(t)$$

If $a(t)$ is determined but not $x(t)$, each integral will involve an additive constant that one is free to select as desired. These can be selected to set the values of $v(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$. Once given, no other free parameters are available. 

This is why higher derivatives of the position do not have their own name. They are all determined by the acceleration and do not enter into the differential equation, so there's no reason to talk about them very much. 

### Uniform Motion

Sciency typically proceeds by separating things into smaller pieces so that they can be examined in isolation and controlled experiments can be designed with them. Thus Galileo attempted to imagine what motion without interaction would be like by extrapolating from what he could observe. He could not prepare a frictionless vaccuum, but he could observe what happened as friction and other interactions were minimized. He imagined a ball that rolled along an infinite flat plane without friction and argued that it would roll at the same velocity forever. 

Such a body would be described by the law 

$$a(t) = 0$$

Evidently, if there is no interaction then there is no acceleration, so if we want something interesting to happen, we need more than one body. 

Newton later used Galileo's conclusion has his first law of motion. The first law of motion is often conflated with the principle of inertia, but it is not the same. *Inertia* was described by Newton as the tendancy of bodies to resist changes in their state of motion, so it has more to do with mass and how a massive body's velocity changes very little when a force acts on it and less with an object that is isolated from interaction.  

### Linear Momentum 

The concept of linear momentum provides us with an idea of what an interaction is like. 

Linear momentum was originally conceived by Descartes as a quantity of motion that would be conserved in all interactions. He observed that a moving ball that strikes a stationary ball will be slower after the collision whereas the ball that was struck will be faster. He proposed that some quantity of motion must have been transferred from one ball to another. 

We call this quantity *linear momentum* because, as we will see, later physicists generalized the concept of momentum to something that is not always conserved and that is quite different from the original idea. 

Linear momentum is usually written with the letter $p$. If it is conserved, then 

$$\frac{d p}{d t} = 0$$



It must be proportional to velocity or else it would violate Newton's first law. 

$$p \propto v$$

If this is so, then any change in velocity of a body must correspond to a change in momentum. Since changes in velocity correspond to interactions and since momentum is conserved, all interactions can be understood as transfers of momentum from one body to another. The constant of proportionality is called the mass, and it can be measured by testing how easy it is to change the velocity of an object. 

Is it also the case that no acceleration implies no interaction? No, because there can be two interactions that cancel each other out. 

In Einstein physics, this is not true because a body that moves at the speed of light can interact with something else without accelerating. In that case, it would not be much like a body but more like a wave packet, and the result of such an interaction would be a change in the wavelength rather than in the velocty. A packet that moves at the speed of light could not accelerate along its own direction of motion, though it can accelerate perpendicular to itself. 

In Galilean physics, it is also true that no acceleration implies no interaction, but this is not the case in Einsteinian physics. 


If it satisfied  

$$F = \frac{d p}{d t}$$

then it would always be conserved because every force would be cancelled out by an equal and opposite force on another body, implying that the sum of all changes to momentum would be zero. Therefore, momentum must be 

$$p = \int dt \frac{d p}{d t} = \int dt F = \int dt m a(t) = m v + C = m v$$

This quantity we call linear momentum because, as we will see, later on in physics the word *momentum* was used in a generalized sense to include other quantities that are not necessarily conserved. 

We will see that the law of inertia is more correct than Newton's second law. When Einstein's special theory is introduced, the principle of inertia will remain and 


## Newton's Second and Third Laws

Newton's second law is a more concrete version of the law of inertia. It says 

$$a(t) = \frac{F (v (t), x (t))}{m}$$

where $m$ is the mass of the body. More massive bodies resist changes in velocity more than less massive bodies. Thus, according to the second law, mass in the resistance described in the principle of inertia. 

$$resistance(z) = \frac{z}{m}$$

Of course, the second law is more commonly written as 

$$F (x(t), v(t)) = m a(t)$$

We can combine this law with the first law with 

$$F_{i j} (x_j(t), v_j(t)) = m_i a_i(t)$$

where $F_{i i} = 0$.

Newton's third law establishes the connection between a force and an interaction. It says that every interaction between two bodies $i$ and $j$ is characterized by two equal and opposite forces. This means that we can write the force as 

$$F_{i j} (x_i(t), v_j(t), x_j(t), v_j(t))$

where $F_{i j} = -F_{i j}$, which implies $F_{i i} = 0$.

### The Principle of Relativity

The principle of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. There are two versions of the principle of relativity: Galilean relativity and Einsteinian special relativity. Einstein's general relativity includes the special relativity, but it also says that the laws of physics are the same in non-inertial reference frames as well. Often, pre-Einsteinian physics is called *nonrelativistic*, which is not true. Galilean relativity has this name not because Galileo discovered it, but because it was always implicit in Galilean physics. 

The principle of relativity is made concrete with some transformation that explains how to look at the world from the perspective of any inertial observer. If the principle of relativity is true, then this transformation will leave the laws of physics unchanged. In Galilean relativity, this is called the Galilean transform. In Einstein's special relativity, it is called the Lorentz transform. The Galilean transform is simply the addition of a velocity to everything. 

$$\bar{x}(t) = x(t) + v t$$
