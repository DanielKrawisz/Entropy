# Matter and Motion

## Long-Range Forces

### Localism

Newton proposed that all matter is attracted to all other matter via a force that is proportional to the mass of both bodies and which diminishes with the inverse square of the distance. He called this force *gravity* and used it to explain both the cohesion of the Earth and all Earthbound matter and the motion of the orbits of the planets, which obeyed Kepler's laws. 

His proposal was controversial because it violated the principle of *localism*, which requires that objects cannot interact without being nearby to one another. People had always understood that objects have weight that causes them to fall towards the Earth from any height that anyone had experienced, people did not imagine that this force extended far outwards into the heavens. Although Newton's gravity fell off with distance, in theory it extended to the stars without limit. 

By contrast, Descartes had attempted to explain the orbits of the planets by vorticies that spun around the sun and pushed on the planets like a kind of wind and he criticized Newton's theory as a kind of mathematical abstraction which did not necessarily pertain to the fundamental nature of the univrse.  Newton's famous statement "I frame no hypothesis" was already a response to this objection. His laws were derived empirically from what had been observed in planetary motion and were not claimed to be statements about fundamental causes. Privately, however, Newton agreed with Descartes that a fundamental theory ought to be local. 

As time went on, other long-range forces came to be understood. The electric force appears very similar to gravity but has a key difference: it is proportional to charge rather than mass. This has two important implications. First, the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Second, an electric interaction with a distant charged body can be detected without a telescope because two bodies with a different ratio of charge to mass can be observed to accelerate differently. By contrast, a telescope is required to detect a gravitational acceleration because everything accelerates the same way in a gravitational field. You would need to see some distant body accelerating relative to you in order to detect gravity. 

The magnetic force also obeys an inverse-square law, but unlike the electric and gravitation forces is proportional to current, which means that two charged bodies do not have a magnetic interaction unless they are both moving. 

Despite Newton, it appears that these laws are quite fundamental. They are still a part of the best currently known laws of physics, even while other qualities of matter that were unexplained in Newton's day, such as heat, have long since been explained in more fundamental terms. However, with Einstein's special and general theories, localism was resored and found not to be incompatible with long-range forces. 

How is such a thing possible? At the very least, a local theory of long-range forces must admit waves. Imagine two bodies that interact via long-range force. If one of the bodies starts to oscillate, the other body must start oscillating as well because the force on it from the first body is changing with its positoin. However, it cannot start oscillating right away because that would be instantaneous communication with the distant other body. The second body must oscillate, but after a time delay. During this time delay, where are the oscillations? They must be travelling through space, between the two bodies. 

Einsteinian theories, those compatible with the special or general theory, all work like this. The force is no longer a true interaction between distant bodies. It is a local interaction with a force field that fills all of space and admits waves. This revised understanding of long-range forces began with the discovery of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, a theory that unified the electric and magnetic forces with light, which turned out to be electromagnetic waves. Newton had, of course, studied light but had never imagined that it was so closely connected with his idea of force. 

Einstein's special relativity was abstracted from Maxwell's equations and his general relativity was discovered by Einstein in his attempt to discover a set of equations that described gravity in analogy to those of Maxwell. Although Einstein's special and general theories are usually and were originally described as theories of *relativity*, relativity has been a part of physics since the time of Galileo. Before Einstein's general theory, the principle of relativity was understood to mean that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial reference frame, meaning that two scientists can pass each other and both think that they are standing still and that the other scientist is moving fast. No experiment they could do would elevate one perspective over the other, as long as neither was accelerating. 

Einstein's special theory did not change the general idea but it did propose that the speed of light was an *exception* to the principle of relativity. Thus despite the fact that theories which incorporate Einstein's relativity are called "relativitstic", the special theory was actually *less* relativistic than the physics of Galileo. Einstein's general theory greatly expanded the principle of relativity to include accelerated reference frames, which could be understood as stationary motion with resistance to a gravitational field. 

With the special theory, Einstein emphasized relativity because the principle of relativity had been temporarily disturbed due to an incompatability between Maxwell's equations and earlier mechanics. Both of these theories obeyed the principle of relativity on their own, but had different ways of changing perspectives which, when put together, destroyed relativity. For mechanics, a change in persective was called the Galilean transformation, and for Maxwell's equations it was called the Lorentz transformation. These two theories put together were not relativistic and they implied that some scientist could detect his velocity relative to the speed of light, which was absolute. 

Einstein argued, however, that physics really *is* relativistic by noting that the Lorentz transform can be understood in terms of the principle of relativity, and that all mechanics could be reformulated to be compatible with the Lorentz transform. This argument not only restored relativity to physics but restored localism as well, which had been missing for a much longer time. Einstein emphasized relativity because that was the current crisis in physics in his day, but vindicating Descartes was a more important legacy of the special theory. 

The compatibility of long-range forces with localism is, in large part, the story of modern physics. The theories which have made this possible are called gauge theories. Gauge theories describe not just electromagnetism and gravity, but the strong and electroweak forces as well. The gauge theory idea is so big that it bridges classical and quantum physics, all the way to gravitation and curved space. Ideas that go beyond known physics, such as grand unified theories and string theory are also gauge theories. Physics has yet to really move past the gauge theory idea, and it all begins with Maxwell. It is arguably the biggest idea in physics and if not it is certainly one of the two biggest ideas in physics, the other being quantum mechanics. 

### Quantum Mechanics

The purport of quantum mechanics is that the best possible laws of physics that we could intuit from experience are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Probability is not new in physics. What is new about probability in quantum mechanics is that it is no longer due entirely to an imperfection in our experimental method but belongs to the fundamental nature of the universe. 

Like many ideas in physics, quantum mechanics is poorly named due to having been discussed before being understood. A better name might be "probability wave mechanics", which would emphasize that which is really new and different in quantum mechanics. Quantization was the first characteristic of quantum mechanics to be observed and recognized as incompatible with what the prevailing framework of physics, which is now called classical mechanics. Yet quantization can be seen everywhere in physics in contexts in which quantum mechanics can be totally ignored. It is always a result of wave mechanics. 

Physicists did not at first recognize quantization as being a result of wave mechanics because of a confusion over what is now called wave-particle duality. 

The understanding of quantum mechanics as a probabilistic theory came later. 

Hidden variable theories.

### Gauge Theories

It is hard to explain what a gauge theory is without a lot of mathematical preparation, but physicists like to describe the world in terms of quantities that are physically real only in the way that they change but not in their absolute value. These quantities are integrals, which means that there is an arbitray additive constant to them, as anyone would have got used to seeing in a calculus class. Energy is an example of such a quantity. The potential energy is a spacial integral, and any additive constant can be added to it to produce identical physics. Physicists typically define the potential energy to ensure that bound states correspond to negative values of potential energy and unbound states to positive values, but this is done for convenience, not because it is required physically. 

To put it vaguely, when the geometry of a theory works out just right, there can be integral quantities that that support a larger range of parameters than simply an additive constant. In a gauge theory, the potentials can be changed by an abstract rotation over all of space and time. Gauge invariant quantities obey partial differential equations that are elliptic and hyperbolic in different derivatives, which means that they describe an evolution of oscillation in time while at the same time obeying constraints ensuring that distant objects always remain connected by a long-range force. 

An implication of gauge theories is that all long-range forces in three special dimensions are inverse square with the distance, as we have observed. Although Newton studied other kinds of forces that he could imagine, such as an inverse cube force, these kinds of forces cannot be reconciled with localism. Quantum mechanical gauge theories can lead to confinement, which means that the force is inverse square for short distances but eventually becomes stronger with distance. This is why quarks are confined to hadrons. Gauge theories also predict a conservation of charge. In the case of gravity, the charges are energy and momentum, so general relativity predicts that these are both conserved, something that had been observed long before Einstein explained it. 

## Inertial Motion

### The Principle of Inertia

An early argument in mechanics concerned the motion of an isolated body. In other words, if some body could be separated from all external influence, such as gravity and friction against the ground and air. Early physicists were not able to actually go somewhere that was isolated from outside influence, so they had to rely on speculation about what an isolated system would be like. Galileo asked his readers to imagine a ball rolling on a plane as sources of friction were gradually removed. He argued that the ball would roll farther before stopping as more sources of friction were removed. The limit of such a sequence would be a ball that rolled on forever without stopping. Whatever its initial velocity, that velocity would be maintained forever. 

Galileo was not the first to argue this position, but his argument was very persuasive and is considered to have settled the point against the most popular alternative theory, which was the theory of Aristotle that all bodies naturally come to a state of rest without outside influence. 

Much later, Galilieo's conclusion that an isolated body would exhibit uniform motion was called the Principle of Inertia, which was not a word that Galileo used. Inertia is a word invented Kepler, a lunatic who spent his life attempting to discover harmonic tones in the orbits of the planets. The concept of inertia was not intended to refute Aristotle, but to make the observed motion of celestial bodies consistent with his theory. Kepler proposed that bodies resisted coming to a state of rest because of some force called inertia would cause it to maintain its state of motion. 

Galileo argued for another principle, now called the Principle of Relativity, that explains the principle of Inertia much better than the theory of inertia, although this was not noted until later. Galileo wanted to argue that the Earth could orbit the Sun without producing any obvious effects in the direction of the Earth's motion, such a kind of wind tearing away the atmosphere. He imagined a laboratory in a moving ship on a very calm sea and asked whether a scientist inside would be able to tell that the ship was moving. 

*Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need to throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every direction.*

Thus, a scientist in laboratory that was moving uniformly from the perspective of someone standing on the shore would not know how he was moving relative to the shore without being able to look out at it. If that is the case, then can we truly say that the laboratory is moving and the shore is standing still in any absolute sense? Not if the Principle of Relativity is true. If there was no ship, no Earth, no Sun, nothing to take as a standard reference of motion, nothing but scientists floating out in space, then each of them would naturally take themselves as their own bodies as a reference frame. All of them might do the same kinds of experiments as those proposed by Galileo and none of them would be able to detect any absolute state of motion. 

Given this, some kind of internal force that would make everything approach a state of rest would be impossible. An isolated body could exhibit no motion other than inertial motion. If it did, then from its own perspective, it would not be slowing down towards a state of rest, but beginning from a state of rest and speeding up in some arbitrary direction. This is an example of a symmetry argument, which have come to take a central position in modern physics due to the amount of predictive work they accomplish for relatively low intellectual effort. 

Hence the Principle of Relativity ought to be understood as the best explation for inertial motion, not inertia, which is not real. Inertia has come to be associated with Newton's first law as a result of a misreading of Newton. Early in the *Principia*, Newton refers to something he calles the *vis insista* which sounds like inertia and which he defines as "a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to persevere in its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a right line". 

Later, Newton introduces his three laws, the first of which states "every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon". Thus, the first law establishes, in agreement with Galileo, that motion at constant velocity is the natural motion of an isolated body. The first law does not say that a body resists change. 

It is not clear whether Newton's concept of the *vis insista* refers to a resistance to an outside force or to some internal force that causes a body to come to a state of rest. In either case, the concept is not used by Newton later on in his book. In the later case, it is contradicted by the first law. In the former, it is made obsolete by the second law, which establishes the nature of that resistence as the mass of the body. I think the best way to explain Newton's writing is that the *vis insista* concept was a way of engaging with his contemporaries to introduce his own way of thinking, which is no longer needed once the reader is familiar with the Newtonian paradigm. 

For modern physicists, *inertia* is simply jargon that refers to the principle that the motion of an isolated body is uniform. Physics students have been confused by it ever since because rarely are they told that the word is simply a vestage from the theories of an idiot who thought that the solar system was a musical instrument. Einstein cannot be understood without knowing what *inertial reference frame* means, not that he is a bad scientist but Galileo did a much better job avoiding jargon and present his ideas parsimoniously. 

### Galilean Physics

The breakthroughs that made Galileo the father of modern mechanics had to do with the way he approached time. Previously, physicists had generally attempted to describe the motion of bodies in terms of geometric curves, which would tend to abstract away a notion of where the body was at a given time. The biggest successes in physics prior to Galileo had to do with motion that was so fast that it could be taken to be instantaneous, as in optics, or motion that could be measured in terms of natural cycles, as in astronomy. Galileo developed new experimental methods to measure small amounts of time and a theoretical approach to motion that treated time as the independent variable. 

In other words, Galileo conceptualized the motion of a body as a position function $x:time->space$ and attempted to explain it by relating physical concepts to the derivatives, $x'(t)$, $x''(t)$, and so on, of position. 

Galileo attempted to describe physics in terms of what would now be called differential equations. Earlier researchers did not consistently take this view and instead tended to look at motion in terms of geometric curves, in the style of classical geometry. The problem with a purely geometric viewpoint is that it matters where the body is at any given time, but the geometric view abstracts this information away. For example, Galileo observed not only that free-falling bodies trace out parabolas, but that their motion parallel to the surface of the Earth is uniform. This observation adds a nuance that prefigures the later notion of a force vector which might have been missed by a classical geometer. 

Galileo's breakthrough was not purely theoretical, but experimental. It began with the invention of the pendulum clock, which could be used to measure small amounts of time. Previously, researchers had success in branches of science in which there were natural clocks, such as in astronomy, or in which time can be abstracted away, as in optics, where a geometric view is appropriate because the motion of light can be taken to be instantaneous. 

### Second-order Differential Equations

Since Galileo, the most fundamental known laws of physics have had the form  

$$x''(t) = f(x(t), x'(t))$$

where $f$ is some function. 

Differential equations of this form are called *second-order*, which means that all derivatives of $x$ that are second-order or higher are determined by $x$ and its first derivative. This is why higher derivatives of the position do not have their own name. They are all determined by the acceleration and do not enter into the differential equation, so there's no reason to talk much about them. 

Why is physics second-order? The answer is not known, but geometry points to a possible answer. Second-order differential equations naturally arise in the theory of geodesic curves, which are the curves that minimize distance in a curved space. When space is curved, there is no such thing as a straight line but there is such a thing as the shortest curve between two points. The differential equation that characterizes such a curve is second-order, and is equivalent to saying that the curve has no acceleration tangent to the space. 

In Einstein's gravity, motion in a gravitational field is geodesic, but not all motion in physics is known to be geodesic. Thus, the connection between physics and geometry is tantalizing but incomplete. The universality of second-order differential equations is certainly a very important and deep principle that remains unexplained.  

### Velocity and Acceleration

In physics, he first derivative of the position is called the *velocity* and the second is called the *acceleration*. 

$$v(t) = x'(t)$$

$$a(t) = x''(t) = v'(t)$$

Velocity is not the same thing as speed. Velocity is speed together with direction. There can be negative velocities. Speed is the absolute value of velocity. Thus, a law of physics looks like 

$$a(t) = f(x(t), v(t))$$

If a function like $f$ can be determined from observations of moving bodies, then it can be used to predict the motion of a body given an initial position $x_0$ and velocity $v_0$ at a given time $t_0$. Since 

$$x(t) = \iint dt^2 a(t)$$

the position is determined from the acceleration up to two arbitrary additive constants of integration. 

$$\iint dt^2 a(t) = \int dt \bar{v}(t) + C_v = \bar{x}(t) + C_v t + C_x$$

Here $\bar{v}$ and $\bar{x}$ are indefinite integrals that result from integrating $a$. The constants of integration $C_v$ and $C_x$ can be selected to set the values of $v(t_0)$ and $v(t_0)$. Once given, no other free parameters are available. 

Of course, the integral cannot be performed because initially we do not know acceleration as a function of time, other than at $t_0$ when it can be determined from $f(x_0, t_0)$. However, implicitly there is still some function $a(t)$ which could be integrated if it were known. 

### Isolated Bodies

Galileo attempted to imagine what motion without interaction would be like by extrapolating from what he could observe. He could not prepare a frictionless vaccuum, but he could observe what happened as friction and other interactions were minimized. He imagined a ball that rolled along an infinite flat plane without friction and argued that it would roll at the same velocity forever. 

Motion at constant velocity is called *inertial* and is described by the law 

$$a(t) = 0$$

Evidently, if there is no interaction then there is no acceleration. If we want something interesting to happen, we need more than one body. We will do this with an index on $x$ to make it a sequence rather than a single value. 

$$a_i(t) = \sum_{j : i\neq j}f_{j->i}(x_j(t), v_j(t))$$

Where $f_{j->i}$ is the acceleration caused by body $j$ on body $i$. 

### Spacetime 

*Spacetime* is a concept that merges Galileo's viewpoint with that of the classical geometer by treating time and space together by treating time as a coordinate like those of physical space. We are only thinking about one dimension of physical space for now, so space time is a two-dimensional space with coordinates $x$ and $t$. In this space, curves can be parameterized by time *or* treated simply as curves independent of parameterization. 

The importance of spacetime is that it simplifies physics conceptually and mathematically, but should not be taken as having any metaphysical meaning. We are not saying that the past and future exist in places outside our experience or that we could move around in time as we do in space. 

### The Galilean Transform

The *Galilean transform* is a coordinate transform of spacetime that brings us from one inertial reference frame to another. If we are on the shore watching the ship, which is moving at velocity $\bar{v}$, we can look at the universe from the perspective of the physicist in the ship's below decks like so: 

$$Galilean(\bar{v})(v(t)) = v - \bar{v}$$

$$Galilean(\bar{v})(x(t)) = x - \bar{v} t$$

Every position function which undergoes a Galilean transformation must be equally valid under the laws of physics as it was before. The laws therefore must satisfy 

$$a_i(t) = \sum_{j : i\neq j}f_{j->i}(x_j(t), v_j(t)) = \sum_{j : i\neq j}f_{j->i}(x_j(t) - \bar{v} t, v_j(t) - \bar{v})$$

This can be accomplished by saying that only relative positions and velocities matter. 

$$a_i(t) = \sum_{j : i\neq j}f_{j->i}(x_i(t) - x_j(t), v_i(t) - v_j(t))$$

### The Lorentz Transform



## Conservation of Momentum

### Linear Momentum 

Now that we know what non-interaction is like, what is interaction like? 

Linear momentum was originally conceived by Descartes as a quantity of motion that would be conserved in all interactions. He observed that a moving ball that strikes a stationary ball will be slower after the collision whereas the ball that was struck will be faster. He proposed that some quantity of motion must have been transferred from one ball to another. 

We call this quantity *linear momentum* because, as we will see, later physicists generalized the concept of momentum to something that is not always conserved and that is quite different from the original idea. 

Linear momentum is usually written with the letter $p$. If it is conserved, then 

$$\frac{d p}{d t} = 0$$

It must be proportional to velocity, by the principle of relativity. 

$$p = m v$$

If this is so, then any change in velocity of a body must correspond to a change in momentum. Since changes in velocity correspond to interactions and since momentum is conserved, all interactions can be understood as transfers of momentum from one body to another. The constant of proportionality is called the mass, and it can be measured by testing how easy it is to change the velocity of an object. 


If it satisfied  

$$F = \frac{d p}{d t}$$

then it would always be conserved because every force would be cancelled out by an equal and opposite force on another body, implying that the sum of all changes to momentum would be zero. Therefore, momentum must be 

$$p = \int dt \frac{d p}{d t} = \int dt F = \int dt m a(t) = m v + C = m v$$

This quantity we call linear momentum because, as we will see, later on in physics the word *momentum* was used in a generalized sense to include other quantities that are not necessarily conserved. 

We will see that the law of inertia is more correct than Newton's second law. When Einstein's special theory is introduced, the principle of inertia will remain and 

Having established that no interaction implies no acceleration, is it also the case that no acceleration implies no interaction? No, for two reasons. The first is that two opposite forces can cancel each other out. This is why modern textbooks often change Newton's first law to say that a body does not divert from inertial motion unless there is a *net* force. Second, a body can have internal motions that that change without affecting its net motion. For example, a body could grow hotter or colder. As we will see, light and other things that move at the speed of light cannot change their speed, but they can still react to forces along their direction of motion. They all have a wavelength which can widen or shrink. 

### Newton's Second and Third Laws

Newton's second law is a more concrete version of the law of inertia. It says 

$$a(t) = \frac{F (v (t), x (t))}{m}$$

where $m$ is the mass of the body. More massive bodies resist changes in velocity more than less massive bodies. Thus, according to the second law, mass in the resistance described in the principle of inertia. 

$$resistance(z) = \frac{z}{m}$$

Of course, the second law is more commonly written as 

$$F (x(t), v(t)) = m a(t)$$

We can combine this law with the first law with 

$$F_{i j} (x_j(t), v_j(t)) = m_i a_i(t)$$

where $F_{i i} = 0$.

Newton's third law establishes the connection between a force and an interaction. It says that every interaction between two bodies $i$ and $j$ is characterized by two equal and opposite forces. This means that we can write the force as 

$$F_{i j} (x_i(t), v_j(t), x_j(t), v_j(t))$

where $F_{i j} = -F_{i j}$, which implies $F_{i i} = 0$.



We define a space

## Newtonian Physics

### Euclidian Space

There are two kinds of Euclidian space. One of them is the space that was actually studied by Euclid and the other is what modern mathematicians call Euclidian space, which is quite different although superficially similar. We will use the later but explain the differences with the former. The essentials of Euclidian space, from the modern perspective, are that it comes with notions of distance and angle and that it is flat, like the tables on which geometric constructions were originally performed. 

Euclid's original space had these properties but it also was two-dimensional and relied entirely on compass and straightedge constructions. A compass is a device for drawing circles and a straightedge is for drawing straight lines. It is through the use of these devices that consistent notions of distance and angle emerged in Euclid. However, they also resulted in a different notion of magnetude than we use today. Euclid did not have a concept of the real numbers, which are foundational in modern treatments. All magnetudes in Euclid are what we would now call algebraic numbers, which means that they correspond to solutions of rational polynomials. And not just any polynomial either. The intersections of straight lines with straight lines, straight lines with circles, and circles with circles correspond to basic polynomials that can be combined with one another to produce more polynomials via methods that correspond to geometric constructions. The set of polynomials that can be constructed in this manner is not the full set of rational polynomials. Consequently there are many numbers that seem quite natural to us that Euclid could not construct, for example $\sqrt{7}$ was entirely beyond Euclid. 

The limitations of compass and straight edge constructions were understood by ancient mathematicians in terms of three famous problems that they could not solve: the trisection of an angle, the doubling of the cube, and the construction of a circle with the same area as a given square. Much of modern mathematics was founded through investigations into what made these problems unsolvable by Euclid. However, physicists don't care about any of that and don't know anything about compass and straight edge constructions. Modern physicists use the real numbers, which are defined in terms of limits of rational numbers. They have no touble trisecting an angle if they feel like it. 

However, the real numbers come with their own difficulties. Any sequence of rational numbers with a limit is a real number. There is a problem with determining whether two real numbers are equal, but we do not have to imagine that we ever have a set of all real numbers so that is not a problem. However, there is a potential problem due to a consequence of Godel's theorems, which is that it is not necessarily the case that two convergent sequences of rational numbers can be proven to be either equal or unequal. 

Real numbers turn into a big problem in physics later when we get to quantum field theory. 

Thus, the modern notion of space as continuous needs to be viewed as an idealization that we cannot currently avoid, not knowing enough about what it is *really* like on a small scale. 

Although Euclid's work is today considered to be a foundational work of mathematics, in some ways it is better understood as a work of physics. Euclid originated the axiomatic method in mathematics, which was so influential that virtually all mathematicians have used it since then. 

The flatness of Euclidian space is a consequence of Euclid's fifth postulate, which says that a point can be constructed from any two lines that are not parallel. The fifth postulate is disturbing because it implies knowledge of space over distances much bigger than any real table. The intersection of two nearly parallel lines could be arbitrarily far away. How would we have abstracted that such a point exists from our experience of real tables, compasses, and straight edges? This may have been a mistake because, as it turns out, curved spaces approach flat space over short distances. Thus, space over real tables may have been imperceptively curved the whole time. 

Nowadays, 

As to Euclidian space being flat, that is intuitive for two-dimensional space, but what does it mean to be flat in higher dimensions? For our purposes, flatness can be understood in terms that are intuitive to imagine. One is that all triangles have $180^\circ$ in them, just as in the two-dimensional version of Euclid. The other is that two figures of different sizes can be congruent. In other words, a big triangle with the same angles at its corners as a small triangle can be uniformly scaled down to fit on top of the little triangle. A flat space in higher dimensions will retain these properties. In curved space this does not work because there is a relationship between the area of a triangle and the sum of its angles. 

### Modern Euclidian Space

### Vectors

Given that we have already discussed Newton's three laws, what is left to put in this chapter on Newtonian physics? In addition to establishing a clear concept of force, Newton also formulated physics in a way that was suitable for bodies moving freely in three dimensional space, whereas the physics of the last chapter was one-dimensional. 

In modern language, Newton formulated his physics in terms of vectors. 

The word *vector* means something different to physicists as to mathematicans. To mathematicians, a vector is an element of a vector space, whereas to physicists a vector is a field that transforms as the vector representation of the rotation group. 

*Field* is another word that means something different to mathematicians vs physicists. To physicists, a field is a function over space. To mathematicians, a field is a set, such as *R* or *C* that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

### Mechanics



## Rotation

Rotational physics has a theory that is exactly analagous to Newtonian physics. 

orientation - position
angular velocity - velocity
angular acceleration - acceleration
moment of inertia - mass
angular momentum - momentum
torque - force

The complexity lies in understanding the form of rotational quantities, which are more complicated than in the Newtonian theory. In $N$ dimensions, position is simply a list of $N$ numbers and derivatives of position are vectors. A rotation is described by a matrix whose inverse is its own transpose. Thus the angular velocity and acceleration are derivitaves of such a thing, whatever that is. 

### Two Dimensions

In two dimensions, a rotation is entirely described by an angle. 

### Three Dimensions

In three dimensions, a rotation must be specified by both an axis and an angle. 

### Parity

I lied above when I said a three-dimensional rotation is a vector. It is actually a pseudo-vector.
