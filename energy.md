# Energy

In everday use, *energy* seems to be a kind of substance found in food, coal, and batteries, and which can be transmitted over electrical wires. However, energy is not a substance but rather a quantity that is abstracted from the configuration and motion of a physical system without actually being a part of any concrete physical thing. In our imagination, energy can appear to flow like a substance because it is conserved and thus if it goes down somewhere it generally rises somewhere nearby. 

Of course, the everyday use of *energy* does not refer to a strictly conserved quantity. Energy gets used up. Food is consumed. A battery runs out of energy and is thrown away. Not all energy can drive machines and living things. The imaginary substance called energy is more closely related to the physics concept of the *free energy* which refers to the energy in a system that is available for useful work. 

$$ H(x, v, p) = V(x) + \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \vec{v}}{2} $$
