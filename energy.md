# Energy

In everday use, energy seems to be a kind of substance found in food, coal, and batteries, and which can be transmitted over electrical wires. However, energy is not a substance but rather a quantity that is abstracted from the configuration and motion of a physical system without actually being a part of any concrete physical thing. However, because the total energy of a system is conserved, if it goes down somewhere it must rise at some nearby place and thus it can appear to flow like a substance. Becasue it is needed for all purposeful motion, abstract thinkers can think of it like a substance that they all need to survive. 

However, the everyday use of *energy* clearly does not refer to a strictly conserved quantity. Energy gets used up. Food is consumed. A battery runs out of energy and is thrown away.
