# Analysis of The Red Pill

## Intro

This is the first part of an analysis of the Red Pill according to Rollo Tomasi,
the writer of the Rational Male series, which are books on commonly believed
purported falsehoods about women, in particular, falsehoods that lead men to
failure with women, and also about the corresponding poorly understood truths
about women. These falsehoods are known as the Blue Pill and the truths are the
Red Pill. So the books are about how to avoid failure with women and
remember that avoiding failure is the secret to success, so the Rational
Male is about success with women, which is usually one of the most important
thing there is if you're a man. Of course, regarding real life kinds of
things it is typically impossible to enumerate all sources of failure
because they are infinite, so therefore the Rational Male does not guarantee
success with women, but the issues discussed in the Rational
Male are fundamental to success with women.

And when I say success with women, I do not
just mean going out to a bar and picking up some girl, I also mean
long-term success within a marriage* to a woman. Success also does not mean
just hitting a home run. It means ensuring that a man's relationships with
women are a net benefit to him. So it's not just about bringing the woman
home to have sex. It may be about getting away from her instead before
she does some serious damage. Or, it may be about success in a long-term
relationship, which means not only sex but also other good things about
women. About being loved instead of undermined. About her obedience versus
her insubordination. It's about in general what men want out of women
and about what motivates women to provide it.

on screen note: *Note: marriage does NOT mean legal marriage!!!

So it's a general theory. It's like the unified field theory of women.
It's what the string theorists wish they could understand. But it's not just
about that it's about the psychological motivations behind pervasive lies
that people tell each other which prevent
the desemenation of the unified field theory of women and thereby divert the
men from ensemenating only women who will make his life better.

Rollo's theory was developed by
interacting with a large number of people, mostly men on the soSauve forums.
He also has a degree in psychology. He also has a marriage that appears to
be successful as far as we know with one adult child. He also claims to have
sleped with around 40 women which if true
would certainly be a good credential and I don't have any
particular reason to doubt it.

In this video I will attempt to introduce Rollo's version of the Red Pill
and analyze it in terms of its importance and accuracy. My credentials are
not as good as his but I will say that I am happy
with my own success with women at the moment if you can believe that.

Why do I want to talk about this? The Red Pill is basically an economics idea
and you know, if you have been watching my content that I think that the
next stage of human evolution is economics. People are adapted
for small tribes, not for giant societies, and the characteristically human
style of reasoning about economics is
more like a bunch of instincts for telling absurd stories about society that
are really only capable of approximating reality when it comes to tiny numbers
of people.

So the Red Pill is very much a
similar thing to the kind of thing to what I have been dealing with and to me,
economics is a major source of reproductive failure in humans.
People keep doing all sorts of dumb things in terms of how to organize
society that lead to mass deaths but no matter how many
could have been prevented by some kind of basic foundation in
economics people act like they have serious psychological issues around
it that they'd rather not deal with.

So the Red Pill guys looked a lot like the next stage of human
evolution that I was talking about. But what they are doing is a more
direct application of economics to human reproductive success. That's what
makes me want to get involved.

## The Matrix metaphor

Before we start talking about the Red Pill, I want to talk about the Matrix
metaphor because I think that this evocative imagery raises bigger questions
than the red pill itself. So I'm going to start by talking about the general
idea that what you think is reality is some kind of illusion, or a web of
lies that serves to make you easily exploitable.

Now the Red Pill metaphor of course comes from
The Matrix and the most profound thing about this metaphor is that there
is a choice between truth and falsehood. This is counterintuitive to me
because I would naturally tend to say that there is no choice between
truth and falsehood. If you believe a falsehood then you don't know
that it is false. If you know
that something is false, then you cannot believe it and there is no choice
but to accept the truth. However, it is possible for a person to accept
or to be aware of reasons that make it unlikely that something he believes
is true but
for these reasons to remain unexamined and sealed off from the rest of
his thoughts so that they never get taken to their conclusions. Living this
way is a choice and it is a very bad choice.

There is a psychological process called cognitive disonnence
which explains how to frame self-deception as a choice. Cognitive
disonnence refers to a discomfort that people feel when they engage
with contradictory ideas. Cognitive disonnence is easiest to understand
in the context of scams, which includes cults and abusive relationships
because they all involve deception in order to get you to buy into
something that's bad for you. Now normally
when you encounter a contradiction, there is some kind of mistake and
that means at least one idea you have is false. So
the contradiction can be resolved by if you can find the mistake and
then you can reject the false idea. However, with scams there is a
psychological reason that people struggle to reject the false idea
is that they don't like the idea of being incompetent. But if
you have bought into a scam, then you have lost something that you
would be better off if you had kept and that's incompetent.
People in this situation may prefer to react against the true idea,
even if they have no rational way of doing so. Instead they will try
to avoid the source of true information and become angry if they can't.

What this means is that if a scam artist can get you to buy into
his scam, regardless of how he does it, then he has leverage over
you because that's the moment that you are motivated to go along
with whatever he says. So when you meet a scam artist there is
going to be something that is like a sales pitch that the scam
artist gives to you before you buy in. He is going to want to get
through this sales pitch as quickly as possible and to try to get
you to buy in by any means necessary because the easier it is for
you to think about what you're doing, the more likely it is that
you will realize it's a scam. He will try to confuse and distract
you so that you don't know what to think about and use emotional
manipulation to make you feel uncomfortable and like you're going
to be a big inconvenience to him if you don't buy in. Once you have
bought in, then the scam artist's position is a lot better because
of your cognitive disonnence. At that point, you will work on your
own to reject any evidence that you have been
scammed. The scam artist can suggest to you how to react to people
who come with evidence that you have been scammed. He can tell
you that they are evil and small-minded and that you need to stay
away from their influence and that's something that you want to
hear from him.

So that's a lot like Agent Smith, a shared personality that invades
people who are connected to the Matrix to fight anyone who has the
truth. He turns ordinary people into antagonists and that is the
consequence of the blue pill. He is
like how people are taught to behave when they meet outsiders. He helps
them to distance themselves from ideas that make them uncomfortable.

Now, there is no absolute way of avoiding error and approaching truth,
but there are steps you can take to help protect you from cognitive
disonnence. You must accept that you can be fooled and you must be
willing to review your earlier decisions for manipulation. That way
if you get fooled you'll get out quicker. Next, you need to be
aware of manipulation in the moment. Pay attention to how a salesman
is making you feel. Someone who is making a
good offer will not be threatened if you want to think carefully
about it and will not be angry if you act like you are going to say
no. Someone trying to sell
you on a scam will exhibit a fake confidence that can be exposed if
you test it.

Now there's also a big problem with the Matrix metaphor and that is
that Morpheus acts a lot like a scam artist. Is he really offering
the truth or his he offering a lie as the truth. In other words
you can interpret the movie as saying that he's
a cult leader and the red pill is the true blue pill because it is an
imaginary world that he is leading you into, not out of, in order to
scam you.

There's a video I'm recommending called "Scientology, the Matrix, and
Disconnection" that uses the Matrix as an analogy to explain how people
get into Scientology. In other words, cults use the idea that they are
leading you to a true world, which heretofore has been invisible to you,
in which very important things are going on, so important that you would
be justified in anything to ensure success, including abandoning your
friends or commiting crimes. Morpheus is more like a guru
than someone with rational arguments that you can verify independently.
He's offering you super powers. How do you know that this is not just
something designed to appeal to you so much that you will not think
criticially about it? You may be unfulfilled by your normal, boring
real-world job and life. That makes you vulnerable to accepting a fantasy
in which you are "somebody important". "You are the one." How do you know
that the real world according to Morpheus is not really an imaginary world?

How do you know that Agent Smith is not simply your projection? When you
see people with the truth, you are trained to think horrible things about
them. So Agent Smith is also how other people look when you have cognitive
disonnence. You see evil in them but really the evil is in you and you
are the one who has transformed in order to keep the truth away. If you
think about the idea that humans are being used as a power plant, it's
easy to see that this is a perpetual motion machine, therefore ruled out
by basic science. Thus, the interpretation that the robot world is some
kind of dream is inevitable, if you want to take thermodynamics seriously.

Cults always say that the world of appearances is an illusion and that
they know about a hidden real world. In this case, I do think that the
Red Pill men have the right idea. However, the use of the Matrix metphor
suggests to me that there is some philosophical problem because it
raises questions that they don't know how to answer.
And you can see that they don't know how to answer it because one of the
things that Red Pill men argue about is who's a grifter and who's for
real. So they have a Byzantine generals problem and they don't know
how to solve it. Byzantine generals problems are more my kind of thing
so maybe I can help with that. One thing I can say is that if you want
a solution to the Byzantine generals problem, you have to be a part of
it. So you have to engage in a variety of ideas and use your own knowledge
to guess at what's really good and bad.

I think Red Pill ideas are pretty easy to support
with science. I can recommend a book called "The Evolution of Desire"
that provides an overview of psychological research on human desire
by an evolutionary psychologist. It certainly complements Red Pill thought
much better than that of feminists or social conservatives.

However, this book is not strategy, it is science. So it is not the same as
the Red Pill. When we are talking about success, we are talking about events
in the future and that means that nobody can be certain they won't be
surprised. Science is about reproducible events, but your life is not a
reproducible event. Science can inform your strategy but it can never *be*
your strategy.

Maximizing reproduction is a contest. If a scientist knew how to do that,
he wouldn't tell you. Success with women is better than having a curriculum
vitae. Science is going to provide at best a baseline for information on
how to succeed with women because someone who had something better than
that would just use it. Of course, you could apply that logic to anything.
If someone was successful with women, what would
be his motivation for transmitting his success to other men who are not
his sons, who are not related to him? That's less evolutionary success
for him and more for them, right?

I think that you can make arguments for both Rollo and me that we have
motivations for passing on good information. Rollo seems like he
cares about the men he's talked to on the soSauve forums, about
how unhappy and hurt they become after making the same
mistakes again and again that society is telling them is a good idea. Of
course, you can also make friends by lying, at least in the short term.
That's basically what a cult leader does. Rollo is an influencer, so
he also makes money with his ideas and of course it can be easier to
make money with a lie than the truth. Of course, he did spend a lot of
time talking about this stuff before he started making money.

As for me I want to drive success of Bitcoiners and my
theory of the value of money is that using the same money creates
similar incentives to that of sharing genetic variation. So I would
want to drive the reproductive success of Bitcoiners as part of a
general strategy to promote the success of Bitcoin. What
I want is for Bitcoiners to get girlfriends, to have successful
relationships, and to raise competent children, and I would want
Bitcoiners to do better at that than the general population.

Nobody else wants you to win more than you do, so you are ultimately
responsible for having the correct strategy advice, for passing on
your DNA, and for raising successful adults.

won't be surprised and that their idea of the future might turn
out to be completely wrong. Evolution is creative,
you know? You can't know for certain what's going to come out of it.
So it's possible that the true future of humanity
is in some completely different style of relationship from that which
is presented in this video, maybe with reversed gender roles or
hermaphrodites or something.

So take this information under consideration, it may be helpful but
there is no guarantee. Maybe I really don't
understand economics so happy to disagree and engage with alternate
arguments and to consider possible ways that I might be participating
in some kind of shared delusion that opens me to parasitism. I
certainly wouldn't want to make that mistake.

## Most Basic Version of the Red Pill
### pictures

Now, what are the red and the blue pills? I think the best way to explain the
blue pill in the most basic possible way is with the stereotyical image of a
man making a marriage proposal to a woman. [picture 1] This is a picture of the
blue pill. In this picture, the man is lowering himself to put the woman above
him and he's giving her an expensive gift. So this image is about the man
transferring wealth to the woman, while at the same time debasing himself in
order to elevate her. And it's more than that because the man's pose is actually
a reference to a feudal commendation, which was the ceremony
by which a vassel secured his allegiance to a lord back in the middle
ages. So in this image, the woman is not merely being elevated in a moral
sense, but potentially in a legal and militaristic sense, in effect
symbolically putting her in command of the relationship. Thus the ring
would be, in this interpretation, not merely a gift, but a kind of tribute
that she's going to demand more of whenever she feels like. Now if you look into
family law, you know that there are many pitfalls for men that make it easy for
women to extract resources out of them so the idea of tribute being part of a
marriage isn't too far from the truth.

The literary convention of courtly love traces back to medieval ballads and
romances such as those by Cristian de Troys. These works were entertainment
for the the upper class. Therefore, not designed to promote good
relationships but rather to promote a fantasy of what the upper class
wanted the lower class to be like. In these romances, there is a knight
who loves a princess and his love is unrequited because he's a lower class
from her, so why would she be interested in him? The knight doesn't care
that his love is unrequited, he's devoted to her and he does all sorts of
impressive stunts in order to glorify her.

When courtly love got started, they knew that a love like this would be
unrequited. However, later on, other genres of litterature that were made
for the middle class adopted their own versions of courtly love based on
medieval romances as a model. These models have been repeated through
the centuries without westerners having noticed that they actually depict
the opposite of what women are really attracted to.

If you elevate the woman, she may be flattered but she's
not actually going to be endeared to you. The only way a woman would be
attracted to that is if she wants to exploit the man. So courtly love and
therefore most romance in stories and movies in Western litterature since
the middle ages, has been advice on how men should self-sabotage.

So what's really going on is kind of like the Matrix. There is an illusion
that was created by exploiters that purports to tell men the right way to
treat women when really it's a way to get exploited by women.
The blue pill is like saying, no, this method really will work to get me
what I want out of a woman, women deserve to be
treated like lords who get tribute, and she really does love me like this.

When Neitzsche talks about the master morality and the slave morality,
this is exactly the kind of thing that he means. The Master morality is the
morality of the upper class. The slave morality is the morality that the
upper class teaches to the lower class, which the lower class then adopts
wholeheartedly. Eventually the upper class goes away for whatever reason,
but the slave morality remains and everyone is acting like it's good to
be easily exploited. If you get fooled and you accept the slave morality,
then you are in danger because you're making it easy on the exploiters.

Now if this image [picture 1] is like the blue pill, then what's the
red pill? The red pill is going to be a picture more like this.
[picture 2] This is more like the kind of relationship a man would
actually want and more like a man that a woman is going to be attracted
to. "Every man should be king in his own castle." The Red Pill
is about how we go from [picture 1] to [picture 2].

* expand this section

Now isn't [picture 2] simply a reversal of [picture 1] and therefore a
depiction of man's exploitation of woman, just as the first picture
was a depiction of woman's exploitation of man? Not necessarily. [picture 2]
could be a picture of exploitation whereas [picture 1] definitely is.
A woman wants a man who could exploit her and this man could exploit this
woman by investing in a different woman and leaving her to make up the
difference when raising their children. She doesn't want that to happen
but she wants it to be something that could happen because if it couldn't
then the man wouldn't be good enough. So [picture 2] could
be a really good deal for both the man and the woman. whereas
[picture 1] would normally only happen if it was exploitative.

Although the relative positions
of male and female have been reversed, the resources are still
flowing from male to female. I don't think that being a provider is a
bad idea. I think it's a good way to raise children successfully.
However, it shouldn't be like tribute that she gets regardless of
anything. It should be something that he controls. She isn't giving him
resources, but she is giving him service not because she is being paid
but because she doesn't want him to have any reason to lose interest
in her.

### Sexual straties

So we have a basic idea of the red and the blue pills, now why is
the red pill true?

The red pill is easy to explain in terms of the difference between the
male's and the females' sexual strategies. For most animals whereas
the male attempts to maximize fitness by optimizing on the number of
partners, the female attempts to maximize fitness by optimizing on
the fitness of
her partner. And the reason for this is simple. In general,
the man is less limited than the woman in terms of the numbers of children
that he can theoretically have.
A male can because he can impregnate one
girl a night whereas she can give birth once every 9 months. Realistically,
that is not the only limitation on children but the man's theoretical limit
is bigger. Of course, not all men approach this limit. In fact, few do.
Men and women have the same average number of children because it takes
one man and one woman to produce a child. Therefore, if the individuals
with the most children are males, then there must, correspondingly, be
more males who fail to have children at all.

What women want is to get in on some the action of the top males
because if they can then they can spread their DNA by attaching it to
his. Her male sons and grandsons will
also be good DNA spreaders and they will spread her DNA along with his.

Of course, a top DNA spreading man would have no real reason to treat
a woman like she was above him. If he can get any woman, then he can
take or leave her.

For a woman, a good deal looks superficially like a bad deal. She likes
being negotiated down because someone
who can drive a hard bargain with her is likely to be a top man. And
you can't make up for not being a top man by giving her perks. She's
attracted to someone who's going to tell her no, not good enough. I
want more.

Neo says "what if I say no?"

Therefore, [picture 1] is not attractive, it's cringy. For both
men and women. Women want someone above them, and men want to be
treated like they on top.

For a man this can be pretty disappointing in formation because it's pretty
hard to treat a woman like you're a top man when you're not a top man. However,
there is hope because men can get better over time. So although most men
are not in the upper class at any given time, many men make it into
the upper class eventually.

### Psychology

So if that's true, all then why do people deceive each other about it
instead of admitting it? The blue pill is a lot harder to explain
that the red pill because we have to explain why people go against
their own interest. The blue pill makes it look like a lot of people
are acting like the only way they can win is if nobody else is playing
the game correctly. Pretty sad. Then everybody has bad relationships.
Why wouldn't good advice be the conventional wisdom?

The blue pill is good for exploitative women because it tells all
women to be exploiters, thus eliminating less exploitative women as
competition and it tells all men to be easily exploited. However,
we need to exploin why men and the non-exploitative women go along
with this. So we need a theory of self-deception and once we have
that we don't really need to imagine some conspiracy of exploitative
women that is driving the blue pill. People can transmit a bad
idea for a long time.

Now we talked about
cognitive disonnence already and we have talked about how men buy into
women, so if you get started following blue pill advice and started
giving woman tribute at a young age, you might get stuck with a bad habit
that you don't want to hear is bad. Now if you go around outside and
start talking to people about men being kings in their own castle you may
see some strong reactions that could easily be interpreted as cognitive
disonnence.

Agent Smith says "Put the woman on a pedistal, Mr Anderson!"

I think you also have to explain why men buy into it in the first place.
I think there is something appealing about the blue pill that makes men
want to believe it, and this is another idea from Neitzsche, who wanted
to explain the prediliction of philosophers to imagine a perfect world
that is separate from the apparent physical world we can all see such as
the world of the forms, heaven, or a future socialist utopia.

Neitzsche's conclusion, following Hericlitus, was that people like to
believe in perfect worlds in order to lie to devalue or deny real-world
risks that they can't control. Heraclitus said that the world is chaos,
which means that no outcome you desire is ever guaranteed, no matter
what you do. You could get struck by lightning tomorrow and then
everything you've done up to this point that you were in the middle of
will be a complete loss.

The function of the perfect
world is to show that your lack of control is not an inherent feature of
the universe. Instead there is some evil that is keeping you away from
perfection. If you accept Jesus into your heart then everything will go
great in the afterlife no matter how badly you screwed up in this life.
If we can just get rid of these capitalists then we can have a perfect
socialist utopia.



A more modern take on this idea might be to say that people have a need
to believe that good will triumph over evil. But if you go out into the
dating market it's definitely not guaranteed that good will triumph
over evil. Love does not always win out. If you want love to win out you
need to strategize or else it probably won't, but even if you do, it still
might not win out.

People seem to hate the idea that they
can't have control over their success. They like games where you put in
the work to get good enough and then you can win. However, life is not
like that. When you are in chaos, then a perfect execution may still
result in failure. Life is a high-stakes game of skill and chance.
Neitzsche's theory is that people hate games of chance so much that they
weave elaborate lies to themselves in order to pretend that that's not
what they're playing, sort of like a gambler who is saying "My number is
due."

Why is it so bad to lie to yourself? The problem with this approach is
that it becomes impossible to implement any strategy that involves
minimizing risk if you are in denial that the risk exists. Thus, while
the psychological function of self-deception is to address a fear of risk,
its real-world effect is to make you more risky than you need to be.

The Greeks had this other idea about fighting the hydra. In a lot of these
Hercules stories, the point seems to be that Hercules is super human so
if he can do something, then you CAN'T do it. He can make death cry uncle
in a wrestling match, he can hold up the dome of the sky, and he can beat
the hydra. The hydra myth is my favorite of the stories of Hercules. The
hydra is a very profound monster. Every time you chop off one of its heads,
it growns two more. Hercules can beat it, but you can't. That's chaos.
The more you fight it, the more it reproduces. It's a problem that gets
worse the more you try to solve it. No one should fight the hydra except
you have no choice becasue you were born and now you're alive.

If you pretend that you can control chaos, if you try to live in a perfect
world, you're trying to chop off all of the monster's heads.
So when you lie to yourself, you're just like Hercules. Except that you
can't win and what's worse, you can't even strategize because you're in
dinal about it.



A mistake
becomes exponentially more costly as your project approaches fruition. So
if you've made a fundamental mistake about the reality you're dealing with,
you're looking at bigger and bigger problems down the line.

Fighting the Hydra

If the truely chaotic nature of the world is too fearsome to accept then a
belief in a perfect world can help you get through life without going crazy.
However, it can also result in disastrous mistakes if you are lying to
yourself about something really important.

So you're a lot better off not lying to yourself. I want to talk about how
to win. And I'm willing to look into potential sources of self-deception in
order to achieve that because maybe my idea on strategy actually isn't
as good as I think. Now to me, success in real life begins with accepting
that you are in chaos. Just accept it. Everything is a big mess. The 2nd
law ofthermodynamics is what's true, and you can't make a power plant out
of people by feeding them with their own dead. That would be a perpetual
motion machine. So the Matrix is wrong on both psychology and physics.



Once I finally grasped Neitzsche's idea I realized it explained many things
that I was experiencing. I have always found the psychology of humans to be
quite confusing. Well Neitzche's theory explains a lot about why people lie
to themselves. If people weren't lying to themselves at all then what? Then
they'd be easy to understand because they'd be ratational. To me, if we
start with rationality and then we add Neitzsche's theory, we get humans.
Or at least, a good approximation. Speaking as an autistic person, Neitzshe's
theory has drastically improved my understanding of people.

So now whenever I someone tells me something that sounds like "here's how you
get to the perfect world", I think "What inescapable risk is he deceiving
himself about?"

Now according to Neitzche there needs to be some idea of perfection for
people to choose to remain in misery, so that's not like the Matrix
at all. According to the movie, there was an earlier version
of the Matrix that had a perfect world and people all rejected it.
To me, this is a big problem with The Matrix beceause it is a psychological
falsehood that was required to explain why a future dystopia would want
to make people believe they live in something like the modern world. But
it doesn't make sense so it would really make you think it's some BS
invented by a cult leader than real information.

In the blue pill way of thinking there is definitely something that is
like a perfect world and that is the woman's love. This is a world where
the woman is perfectly loyal to the man. The red pill says that no woman
is perfectly loyal. And worse, woman do not trade loyalty for loyalty. So
you cannot get any desired level of loyalty from a woman by being loyal to
her. Would you date a knight if you were a princess? The princess replies
to the loyalty of the knight with disloyalty to him. To her he is an option
and not necessarily a very good one.

In the blue pill mindset, a woman is not like that. She is someone whose
loyalty can be bought with the right actions or can be acquired with using
the right words. If something goes wrong it was because you didn't do
something right and not becasue she just fundamentally doesn't like you.
Now I'm not fundamentally saying that all blue pillers believe something
exactly that unrealistic but the blue pill involves a fundamental
overestimation of women because of a denial about the disadvantages of
women in general. There is no way that there is something bad about women
in general. Generalities about women must be good.

However, the truth is, there are things about women in general that are bad
for men. That does not mean that a relationship with a woman cannot, in the
net, be good. But there are some disadvantages that you cannot escape from.
You do not win a woman over once and then she's yours. She wants you to
win her over again and again. And could it ever be any other way?
Reproduction is what life
is all about. It's a high stakes game. and people will do anything
to win. The only way to be safe is not to play. But if you do that then
you lose a lot.

A woman will never stop testing your strength. That's
important for her to know because she needs strength. Not just physical
strength but strength in general. What is the best way to test the strength
of a man as a woman, given that
all men will do anything to try to lie to you about it? Well it's
to attempt to sabotage him. To exploit him. Can she do something to break him.
Can she crack his exterior? If she can then he's probably not strong enough.
This is something women never stop doing. The
woman is chaos. Just as the outside world is periodically attempts to
destroy you, so does the woman who greets you when you come home.
Hopefully not in some kind of literal way but in a way that puts you
at risk of humiliation or embarassment.

I would say, that the woman acts like she's a metaphor for
whatever is the most difficult thing about whatever society you live in.
So if you're in a hunter gatherer society, she's like the wild animal that
you need to hunt or like the predator that's hunting you. In an agricultureal
society, the woman is like the land. In a capitalist society, the woman is
like the customer. The woman becomes like whatever is the biggest source of
chaos that the man deals with while he's keeping society going. And this
makes sense because she wants to test whatever strength is needed in her
society.

This is called a shit test. The point of a shit test is basically to trick you into
humiliating yourself in front of her. Of course, it is bad if she succeeds
because then she won't like you as much but on the other hand, ensuring
her failure with shit tests is the most reliable method of stimulating her
sexual arousal. So you can't have a perfectly loyal woman because you can't
be 100% on shit tests no matter how good you are, but you cannot have any
good relationship with a woman unless her shit tests fail at least some of
the time. You cannot guarantee that any relationship with a woman
will not end in tragedy. However, on the other hand,
if you stop living in a fantasy about her, you can probably get much more
reliable relationships that are closer to what you would like than you
could have before.

### Why do women go along with the blue pill?

I have answered why men go along with the blue pill and it's because
they don't want to accept that women have cooties. So why do women go along
with it when they may be able to get a really good man by refusing to be
a princess?

Women fear what they most desire because the most desirable
man cannot be controled by them. Someone she desires has strength where
she knows she has weakness. So women can allay fear by
destroying that which they most desire. If they don't realize that's what
they're doing then they would go along with the blue pill.

I have now explained the red and the blue pills in the most basic
way possible. The blue pill is the idea that it is safe to elevate the
woman and open yourself up to exploitation when really it is not. If you
do that you are acting like the opposite of someone who is attractive to
women. The red pill is that you need to devalue the woman in order to be
attracted to her and it makes sense to devalue her because she's not as
good as you think she is.

Heraclitus said that people will never look at the truth, but I think
you can say that the Red Pill is probably true based on evolutionary
psychology, Neitzche's theory of self deception, and the fact that you
can see cognitive disonence in blue pillers.
