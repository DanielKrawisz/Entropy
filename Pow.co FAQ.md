# POW.co FAQ

## What is POW.co?

PoW.co is a website from The Proof-of-Work Company that enables users to upvote content using Bitcoin's [proof-of-work](#what-is-proof-of-work) function. 

There is no institution that curates the content with the power to manipulate numbers or use artificial intelligence against you. All content and engagement data is referenced on-chain and there are no moderators or moderation other than the legal system. Due to the economics of the [Handicap Principle](#what-is-the-handicap-principle), engagement in terms of ⛏ is expected to predict the relevance of the content. Thus, content at PoW.co is both unmanipulated and [relevant](#what-is-relevance). 

## What is Boost POW?

Boost POW is protocol defined using Bitcoin transactions that categorizes the relevance of content via the market-driven moderation of proof of work. Boost POW is backed by the economics of the [Handicap Principle](#what-is-the-handicap-principle), which means that the content is expected to be relevant. 

When content is boosted, funds are locked in a hash puzzle. Behind the scenes, someone with hashpower can redeem the funds to create a proof-of-work string. When the puzzle has been solved, the content appears on PoW.co with the additional ⛏ added to its total. 

## What is ⛏?

⛏ is a unit that is proportional the expected amount of energy spent for each ranked content.  

Bitcoin miners know it as *difficulty*, which is equal to the expected number of SHA2_256 hash operations of the Bitcoin genesis block. Approximately 2^32 hashes have been performed recently on any meme at PoW.co for every unit of ⛏ reported.

⛏ is known by evaluating proof-of-work strings that other users have ordered which can be read directly from the blockchain. This means that you do not depend on us to know how much people have engaged with the content at PoW.co. 

## Why does ⛏ matter?

⛏ matters because it is a measure of provable waste, which is the [definition](#what-is-a-handicap) of a handicap and therefore an honest signal of fitness. It is attached to proof-of-work strings that are associated with memes, which are therefore expected to be fit. If you ignore ⛏, you are ignoring information that is easy to find and expected to be relevant, which is something that you cannot afford. 

## What is the Handicap Principle?

The Handicap Principle is an idea from Zahavi which says that the only honest signal of fitness is provable waste. The idea was originally proposed to explain sexual signals in biology such as the peacock’s tail but the principle is general and has applications anywhere that the members of a large group need to find mates or make good allies quickly. 

In human society, think about how business suits can separate those who are serious from those who are just playing a commercial typically has higher production values than the content it appears with. The Handicap Principle says that someone with a good product can much more easily afford to distinguish himself using a costly advertisement than someone with a bad product because he will have more accepted offers and can therefore make up the cost more easily. 

## What is a handicap?

A handicap is provable waste. 

## What is waste?

Waste in this context means that something is destroyed but not uselessly or to no avail because its destruction can be expected to yield a holistic and thorough appraisal. 

## What is fitness?

Fitness is the relative ability to grow and avoid death. 

## What is proof-of-work?

Proof-of-work is a meme with antlers. In other words, it is a message that includes a solution to a cryptographic [hash puzzle](#what-is-a-cryptographic-hash-puzzle). Such a solution functions as a [handicap](#what-is-a-handicap) and therefore as an [honest](#what-is-honesty) signal of [fitness](#what-is-fitness). 

Memes with antlers are superior candidates for reproduction than those without. As Graffen [has shown](), males with no advertisement deserve no attention by females. In the same vein, memes without antlers don’t deserve attention from Internet users. 

## What is a cryptographic hash puzzle? 

A cryptographic hash puzzle is a computational problem in which an input must be found that hashes to a certain value or to satisfy certain constraints. A cryptographic hash function by definition cannot be inverted significantly faster than with random trials. Thus, a hash puzzle can be used to specify a certain amount of work in terms of random trials must be done in order to find a solution. 

## Why does a hash puzzle turn a meme into a proof of work?

Proof-of-work is not literally a proof of work. A better term might be *evidence of value*. Someone who made a proof-of-work for no reason would be wasting energy. You would expect that such behavior would not be sustainable long-term. Someone who was maximizing his own energy would not make a proof-of-work without having something important to broadcast. That means that the message must be something that other people would be interested in. That is not absolute proof that the message is worth reading. As Grafen [has shown](), a costly signal is expected to be proportional to fitness, which does not mean that any *particluar* proof-of-work is any good. Rather, proof-of-work is good for selecting content that is *probably* worth reading and rejecting content that *probably* isn't worth reading. 

## Is proof-of-work a metaphor?

Is a degeree or patent proof-of-work or is proof-of-work a solved hash puzzle attached to a broadcasted message? The problem with menaphorical uses of "proof-of-work" is that they are not economically similar enough to real proof-of-work to be a good comparison. Degrees and patents may be literal proofs of work but they are not honest signals of fitness because they are not handicaps. Handicaps are easy to evaluate, whereas degrees and patents are not. Contextual information and expertise would be require to evaluate them properly. Proof-of-work provides a number that can be evaluated instantly in a computer, and the number cannot be manipulated with any known trickery. A patent or degree is more like something that you would look at *after* you had evaluated the proof-of-work. 

## What is the problem that handicaps solve? 

TL;DR- They allow you to save energy and time in discovering and distinguishing between that which is valuable and honest over that which is deceptive.

Everyone wants good relationships but nobody wants to admit to being unfit. An honest signal of fitness would eliminate the problem of unfit members lying about their fitness in order to exploit others. Without handicaps we would expect to be surrounded by lies about fitness and must bear a heavy cost of navigating through them. 

We all have limited resources to evaluate candidates and if there are too many to give them all a close look, we need a way to limit the sample of candidates down to a reasonable number that is not time-consuming but also not likely to eliminate the best ones. 

This is clearly important in sex because mistakes with sex is costly and it is important to be as certain as possible beforehand that it is not a mistake. Of course, no one wants to admit that they are less fit because then they would get less sex. Thus, without an honest signal of fitness everyone will be overwhelmed with lies about who is fit, and the next generation will be full of unfit mutants. In other contexts the consequences of not using handicaps will be similar. Using handicaps, we avoid the consequences of bad relationships before they happen. 

This translates into the world of categorizing valuable data, but acknowledging that we all play the role of the female gaging the value of data providers.  In like manner to how costly signals help with sexual selection, information of any type can now possess handicaps thanks to BoostPoW. 

The costly signals of handicaps keep us from being manipulated by others.

It is important to note that handicaps are not as negative as they sound because they show success and fitness over time.  Only truly successful information can sustain the costliness of handicaps. 

## Why do memes need an honest signal of fitness?

The biggest problem we have is the problem that handicaps solve. 

As Richard Dawkins has explained, memes are alive and want to reproduce as much as possible, just like biological life. _Meme_ is just another word for _idea_, and our society is overrun with ideas that are unfit because they promote the destruction of civilization and therefore of our brains, which is the only environment they can survive in. We need a better way of evaluating ideas before they reproduce too much. This is the problem that handicaps solve and we can solve it by requiring memes to grow antlers. (Antlers are handicaps for stags). 

Memes are like males that will use any trick to get into your brain and reproduce. Consequently, and people have acceptaccepted bad ideas that play with their feelings without thinking about them thoroughlyenough. any idea that plays with their feelings. 

Memes that enable parasitism and other abuse spread easily with cheap talk and emotional manipulation. Memes need to make a sexual display just like the peacock before they are allowed to reproduce inside our brains.

At PoW.co, the design of the page puts you in search of a good idea just as the peahen goes in search of the peacock. Your computer can assess costs, tens of thousands of times a second, and order ideas in terms of the strength of their signal.

Screen space is precious real estate and your personal time is scarce.  You can stop scrolling whenever you get bored. In this way, you have limited the number of ideas down to an amount that you can reasonably assess, whatever your brainpower. If you think that an idea has been poorly assessed, you can take the standpoint of the male and boost it higher.

BoostPoW increases valuable signals as it drowns out noise.  

BoostPoW is superior to, and has the ability to enhance, other social networks because it honestly empowers the best of ideas and data to attain the valuable focus that they deserve. 

Traditional social media provides the appearance of readily accessible relevant information, however we all know that this is highly manipulated by central planners- whose goal is to exploit you.  

At a traditional social network, one would expect less noise at the expense of a lower overall quality. At a given reddit subreddit, for example, you would expect all content to be at least minimally relevant due to moderation. 

At PoW.co, you would expect to see at least some ideas that are not relevant at all. However you would also expect to find the best idea much more quickly and easily than on reddit or Facebook or another one of those networks where the whole point is to manipulate you. 

## Why is a handicap an honest signal of fitness?

Handicaps are honest because they demonstrate cost. Boost gives content the ability to signal fitness. There is no other upvoting system or marketing that has this honest indicator. 

Some sites have up/down voting systems.  In the past, sites have eliminated the downvoting features and eradicated honest feedback.  With Boost it is costly to manipulate data.  

Here is a more detailed explanation on how incentives are aligned via the Handicap Principle:

A candidate (or in our case content) who wants to signal fitness using a handicap must choose how much cost to demonstrate given his limited resources. The candidate/content, and must weigh the benefit of a greater signal against the benefit that is losthe loses by using those resources in other ways. 

At a given level of signal, a more fit candidate faces a better trade-off from a bigger signal than a less-fit candidate. The more fit candidate can both more easily bear the cost and will gain more from the extra attention he will receive from evaluators.  Exposure via boost could be deadly for content; it invites more shrewd evaluators.  As a result, more fit candidates optimize at higher levels of signal than less-fit candidates. Handicaps are honest because they make deception unprofitable. 

## What about someone who lies to look better even though it’s against his own interest? 

TL;DR- Lies always go against the liar's interest, if they can be exposed for lying.  Boost makes it easier for liars to be found out. 

Evolution works over time and this is an ongoing process that will eventually weed out all liars. 

A less fit candidate who signals as a more fit candidate has a harder time staying alive and will die more before he gets a chance to be evaluated. (Deceptive content will not last over time after being found false by evaluators). Furthemore, if he does get to be evaluated, he will still not pass evaluation as much as someone who is more fit. 


Handicaps do not absolve evaluators of the need for good judgment. A handicap is best understood as the first step in thean evaluation process. Evaluators have limited time in which to find the best candidate and can use handicaps to limit their sample down to a tractable number that is unlikely to have eliminated the best candidates. 

A liar may use a handicap to get into the second round of evaluation when he doesn’t deserve it, but evaluators will compare him to the other candidates at this point and reject him for other reasons. A customer may remember a product because he saw an advertisement that stands out but if the product does not ultimately please him, he will not buy it. 

## What is honesty? 

TL:DR- Honesty is the proper rank of value and importance regarding specific content. Costly signals help determine the relation of content to its surrounding world.  

Good question. A candidate’s optimal strategy is to signal in proportion to his fitness. But what is the correct proportion? Above we said that more fit candidates (content) signal more than less fit but that does not tell us what the right amount is for a given candidate. 

The answer has to do with the benefit of more attention. A better candidate can expect more accepted offers but how much more exactly? He would have to know that before he knew how much to signal. The only way to know that is to know about the competition from the other candidates. If the competition is bad then he wants to signal a lot more but if it is good then he wants to signal a little more. 

Thus, honesty in this context is not simply a matter of telling what you know. It is also a matter of collecting information to be as right as you can possibly be. There are consequences for being wrong and no forgiveness for mistakes. 

Handicaps change the game from one in which everyone is trying to reach the top to one in which everyone is trying to select their own best rank. We can start to see that this is a very interesting game because honesty is not easy. Honesty is a matter of understanding the relationship between yourself and everything else. 

## If handicaps are not perfectly honest, then how honest are they?

TL:DR- Honest signals of handicaps save energy and time.  This helps in the evaluation process of honesty.  

As Graffen showed, costly signals are honest on average but not absolutely. Honesty may be the optimal strategy, but as we have seen above, honesty is also not easy. Because of mistakes and lies, there is a correlation but not an exact relationship between handicap and fitness. 

Although handicaps are honest signals of fitness, they are not the final word on fitness. They are useful because they save time. The time that is saved with handicaps can be used to assess fitness even more closely. Among the candidates that pass the handicap test, some may still be truly unfit but at least one is expected to be very fit. Without the use of handicaps, the truly fit candidate may not be discoverable in a reasonable amount of time. 

# What if a candidate refuses to use a handicap because he doesn’t want to get trapped in an honesty game? 

Boost PWW will eventually become as viceral in content evaluation, as the handicap principle is in mate selection.  Anyone objecting to participate in the honesty game would be seen as concealing their content due to inadequacy. 

This is related to an important early objection to the Handicap Principle that was made by Maynard Smith, who developed a model in which only fit males would signal and unfit males would try to conceal their inadequacy. Such a situation is only possible when males have a binary choice to signal or not to signal. When males can signal at any level they all signal in proportion to their own fitness. 

## Is anything that demonstrates cost an honest signal of fitness? 

TL;DR- Handicaps are preferred and easily identifiable to evaluators because they are both costly and save time.  Evaluators demand that content be clear and time efficient.  

Costly content that is a convoluted waste of time will be easily regarded by evaluators as evasive for some unknown reason, depreciating its ability to be assessed.  

For example, plastic surgery is a costly indicator where the evaluator has to take extra time to see the actual natural qualities of the candidate.  

Although Graffen proved that every honest signal must demonstrate cost, it does not follow that every costly signal is honest. A cost may be difficult or easy to evaluate. A handicap is easy to evaluate because waste is the most easily assessed cost there could be., Abut a cost that is difficult to evaluate can be dishonest because the candidate may be hoping that an evaluator may not look at it closely enough to assess it correctly. 

Remember, handicaps save time! A candidate who does not help evaluators save time is treated like a bad candidate by evaluators regardless of how good he really is. He may demonstrate cost, but they will still treat him like a bad candidate. Why? Because he is more likely to be a bad candidate. Handicaps are a way of rejecting candidates quickly who are likely to be bad. This was understood by Zahavi but missed by Graffen, whose work on costly signals shows that they are honest but not that they save time. 

## Why is provable waste the only honest signal of fitness?

TL;DR- Yes, because provable waste is the only honest signal that gains by attrition over time. 

Because handicaps are competitive with other possible signals of fitness and win out over them by competition. If a handicap were in competition with some other signal of fitness, evaluators would save more time by using the handicap than using the other signal because provable waste would be easier for them to assess than any alternative. Some competing signal of fitness, while not as good as a handicap, may survive as a second step in an evaluation process that happens after a handicap, but it would not survive on its own. 

An important kind of argument that has been made against the Handicap Principle is that signaling games can be designed which do not involve handicaps but for which the optimal strategy is to be honest. This would seem to contradict the claim that handicaps are the only honest signal of fitness. However, although the Handicap Principle is not true if it is taken as a statement of logical necessity, it is true as a statement about the real world because nothing else is as good. 

Theoretical biologists who have argued against the Handicap Principle have followed Graffen in missing the fact that handicaps save time and therefore have not understood that handicaps win out over alternatives. 

## If handicaps are the only honest signal of fitness, does that mean that other social networks are dishonest because they don’t use handicaps?

TL;DR- No not necessarily, it simply means that with Boost we save time in the evaluation process of fitness, value, and/or honesty.  

In a sense. Unfit memes cannot ultimately win out because they destroy their own environment. Truth tends to win out over deception in the end regardless of whether we use handicaps. When we use handicaps we would expect this to happen a lot more quickly. Remember, handicaps save time. On other social networks we would expect unfit memes that are not symbiotic to overtake fit memes a lot more easily in the short term. 

We save the biggest costs by identifying errors early and correcting them before they cause damage. Thus, although truth tends to win out in general, we greatly improve our situation by ensuring that it wins out quickly rather than slowly. 

## Why is waste the most easily assessed cost?

Because waste has no benefit. 

## What is cost?

TL;DR- Alternate ways energy and resources could have been spent elsewhere on other content over that which is boosted.  Boosted content has meaning to the degree that the energy spent on it could have been spent elsewhere. 

As Graffen has said, “the cost of a signal is the key to its meaning”. In Austrian economics, all costs are opportunity costs. In other words, the true cost of anything is everything else you could have done instead. Thus, cost is both the meaning of the message and the alternative to the message.

Since different kinds of handicaps waste different resources and therefore have different costs, we may well ask which one is the most meaningful as a signal of fitness? 

In evolutionary theory, all cost is fewer viable offspring and more risk of death, which is the opposite of fitness. Thus, if a true signal of fitness must demonstrate cost, then what it is really doing is bringing the bearer closer to death and failure. Thus, the best handicap for any given animal is the one which corresponds to the resources that are the most necessary for its success and whose loss brings it closest to death. 

## Do I approach death when I boost content on PoW.co? 

Yes. 

## Why would I do that? 

Because you want to live in a world where people have good ideas rather than bad ideas and you know that approaching death is the only way for honest folk to get more attention than manipulators. 

## That answers why I would use PoW.co in general but not why I would boost any specific content. Why is any particular meme worth approaching death for? 

TL;DR- Because truth is the appetite of the human intellect.  We are constantly driven for better information to improve our survival.  

If a meme moves up one rank, more people see it and evaluate it. If the meme is truly fit, then all those people are improved by it and you are improved as well because now your society is better and you get to live in it. 

## If I buy proof of work, isn’t it really the miner who is demonstrating fitness?

No because you pay the cost and therefore the miner does not bear it. 

## Why not simply use payments to upvote content. Satoshis cost something, do they not?

TL;DR- Because the waste of energy is innately understood as it pertains to our physical survival. This is energy wasted that we will never get back.

Payments are not an easily assessed cost because it is possible to pay someone back with another transaction that is not known to be connected to the first one. In that case, no real cost has been demonstrated even though apparently it has.

Furthermore, the cost of satoshis is not the same as the cost of energy. The cost of money is everything that is unknown in the economy, whereas the cost of energy is something that is very near to all of us because we all use energy in our own bodies and machines. Even if you burn satoshis, that is not genuine waste because satoshis are non-physical so nothing was really destroyed. The cost of satoshis cannot be understood without reference to the whole economy whereas the cost of energy is innately understood at least to some extent by all living things. 

## What if I pay for proof-of-work and the miner pays me back? 

TL;DR- Energy is still wasted as it pertains to the meme specifically.  Incentives are naturally aligned where the miner’s well being would be affected if they were to pay you back.  

(We are the environment of the meme’s fitness.  The miner paying back becomes part of the meme’s environment.)     

That doesn’t matter because cost was still demonstrated with proof-of-work and that’s all we care about. It is really the meme that is signaling fitness, not you or the miner. The meme is destroying its own environment when it has proof-of-work attached to it because it is bringing its host closer to death. If you pay for proof-of-work then you are the part of the meme’s environment that is being destroyed and if the miner pays you back secretly, which he would not do unless he believed that the meme was fit, then he is the environment that is being destroyed. 

## I don’t like the idea of paying to upvote content. 

TL;DR- Then you would be missing out on a market driven curation of information.
Would you prefer a platform where you can say whatever you want at no cost no matter how stupid it is or would you prefer one where you get good information by reading it? The benefit of a proof-of-work upvote system is better information. To put this another way, peacocks don’t want to grow a big tail. They just want to have sex. The females don’t give them any other choice but to grow a tail. When you are a reader of PoW.co, you are like the female. That is when you get the real benefit. 

## How do I know how much ⛏ to buy?

TL;DR- If you are a specialist on the topic of a specific piece of content, you may find it imperative to help in the ⛏of content; either by buying more ⛏or by promoting the content amongst your peers.  

As discussed above, honest signallers must understand themselves in relation to everything else. The meme cannot do this on its own so you must help it approach its correct rank. Other people will help, so you don’t necessarily need to move it all the way there. However, if it concerns something that you know especially better than everyone else you may need to help a lot. It’s ultimately about understanding your own knowledge in relation to everyone else’s. 

## It sounds easy to break this system. There is nothing stopping a person from boosting fake news.

TL;DR- We welcome you to try.  Incentives are naturally aligned so that such actions are suicidal.  Eventually, the market will learn that it will be more profitable to simply be honest. 

See above. We invite you to try boosting irrelevant information and see where it gets you.

Honest actors benefit from boosting good information because they improve the world around them. Thus, they do not lose as much as someone who is boosting fake news and you will never gain as much from subverting the system as they will from upholding it. The difficulty can go as high as it needs to and dishonest actors will be priced out faster than honest actors.

There _is_ something stopping you from boosting fake news, and that is the opportunity cost of boosting something good and gaining the benefit. Manipulative ideas that serve parasites are incapable of winning at PoW.co. If you try being a troll, all that will happen is that you will either run out of money or get bored and turn good.

# Can't some billionaire manipulate the system by boosting any propaganda he wants to the top?

TL;DR- The billionaire can try if he/she wants to waste a lot of resources up until the time the market catches up to his/her deception.  

Yes and no. As can be seen from the previous answer, Boost does not mean that the top idea is automatically better than the next highest idea. Rather, it is a cut-off that is used to limit the number of ideas that users engage with, however many they can handle. In order to control the conversation, a manipulator would have to control the top several upvoted memes, however many the audience he wants to manipulate would typically read.

Thus, controlling the system for your own benefit costs a lot more than benefiting everyone with it. A billionaire might attempt this, but it would be a lot worse than trying the same thing with the mainstream media, which is entirely based on cheap talk.

Furthermore, he would not be able to prevent those who didn't fall for his lies from communicating with one another, as happens with moderation on other platforms. Those who weren't fooled would just scroll down further in order to get to the good content. Eventually, his waste of resources would get the better of him and those who were better at conserving energy would again be able to boost their content to the top position.

# Doesn’t proof-of-work need a predator to make it meaningful? 

TL;DR- The ultimate predator is scarcity of energy and time in regards to content. 

This is an objection made by Craig Wright in . 

It is certainly true that opening oneself up to predation is costly. However, there are many costs other than the risk of predation. Spending energy inherently brings anybody closer to failure. Whether or not a predator exists may change the degree of risk involved, and hence the optimal level of signaling, but it does not change the nature of the game. 

# What is the cost of proof-of-work?

TL;DR- Energy that could have been used in other things; opportunity cost. 
The cost is energy, and the opportunity cost of energy is motion in general. Thus one who signals with proof-of-work has the ability to transform energy and sustain motion. It is a machine that won't turn off regardless of the external conditions.

If a costly signal was truly a signal of fitness, therefore, it must have life and growth as its meaning, which means that life and growth must be the alternatives to the signal. In other words, handicaps are always about approaching death.

Since energy is abstract, the machine is not associated with any particular way of storing energy. The fitness to transform energy in general is the ability to transform into whatever is needed. Not just that, but it has optimal intelligence in order to understand how to transform.

## So on PoW.co, you would expect people to be talking about how to continue to transform energy no matter what happens? 

Exactly, and that is another word for survival.  

## If a meme is fit, does that mean I can accept it without thinking? 

TL;DR- No, you are not absolved from your need to make personal judgements. 

Theoretically yes but remember handicaps are honest on average, not absolutely. You can use them to collect a sample of information that is likely to be relevant but you cannot use them to think for you and they do not absolve you of the need for judgment. 

The difference between PoW.co and other platforms is that here honesty is expected although not absolutely certain, whereas on other platforms dishonesty is to be expected, especially for information that is very relevant and for which a lot can be gained from deception, such as politics, economics, and health. 

## What is a fit meme? 

TL;DR- This is evaluated over time via BoostPoW.  Truly fit memes will grow in acceptance and costly signaling over time.  

Fitness is about avoiding death, so a fit meme is one that will continue to reproduce in people’s brains for a long time. Over the long term, a meme can destroy its own environment by leading people to their deaths or mental degeneration. This is the kind of unfit meme that we can stop at PoW.co. A fit meme will enhance its own environment so that there will always be lots of brains. It will be something that tells us how to survive. 

A meme’s environment is all the other memes, not just people. Fit memes are symbiotic with other fit memes as well. Hence a fit meme will fit into a larger whole that tells us how to survive and thrive in general. 

Of course, circumstances change. A fit meme one day may not be fit anymore the next day. The conditions of survival change and hence the relevance of information changes over time. Ultimately, the question of which memes are fit is a big collective puzzle that we all contribute to by using PoW.co. 

## What is relevance?

I don't know, you tell me. We all need each other to teach us what we know.
