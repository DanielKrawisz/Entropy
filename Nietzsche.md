# Nietzsche's Psychology

Nietzsche is a well-known but poorly understood philosopher who is best understood as a proto-psychologist who performed psychoanalysis on himself. His philosophy was an inspiration for the psychoanalysts in the following generations, especially Karl Jung, who can be understood as having adapted Nietzche for the masses. Nietzsche is associated both with the existentialist and totalitarian movements of the 20th century but but the real Nietzschian superman is Maslow's self-actualizer. 

The following diagram is my interpretation of Nietzsche's psychology. At no point did he lay out something like this is a compact form in any one book. Rather, Nietzsche developed this picture over time and each of his books expound on different aspects of it. 

Nietzsche made the distinction between the Dyonisian and Apologian temperment in his first book, The Birth of Tragedy Out of Music.
